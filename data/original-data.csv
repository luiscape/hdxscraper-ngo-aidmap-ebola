These HEWs take on the roles of other health care workers as needed and are crucial in closing the longstanding gap between quality health care and rural communities. Through the support of the Barr Foundation, Amref Health Africa aims to build the capacity of 2,000 HEWs who have the potential to reach up to 5 million people living in rural Ethiopia.

Clean water also has the benefit of decreasing health risks associated with polluted water sources. The newly constructed wells can last more than two decades, helping thousands of people with daily tasks across the region.

Water well projects continue into 2014. Water wells have been implemented or proposed in Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Kenya.

This camp supports the influx of Eritrean refugees escaping violence and hunger. The stoves are portable and simple to use, only requiring the sun's rays. 

Solar power is a renewable resource that harnesses the sun as an energy source. Reliance on wood as an energy source has left many areas of the Horn of Africa vulnerable to desertification. Fragmentation of forests and shrubland in the region leaves people more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The solar stove alleviates these risks and also decreases the amount of time that women must spend foraging for wood, increasing safety and security. ","ARAHA realized the needs of refugees in camps throughout the Horn of Africa who lack basic cooking infrastructure. The solar stove is a sustainable product that utilizes the sun's rays to create a heating effect. The stoves are lightweight and portable, two qualities which are essential for refugees, who move around very often.

The first solar stove distribution occurred in 2013, where 200 families of approximately 5 members each received a solar stove in the Shegarab Refugee Camp. As part of the project, families were trained by local high school students on how to use the stove.

Because of poor or nonexistent health facilities, people are at a high risk for contracting disease or illness. Because proper treatment is scarce, preventable diseases can be debilitating or even fatal.

Distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets reduce the risk of malaria, especially in areas recovering from heavy floods. ARAHA is involved with a number of mosquito net distribution projects, which are often accompanied with other non-food items and emergency food baskets.

In 2014, ARAHA will partner with Life for Relief and Development in assessing the needs of the Daynille Hospital in Somalia. Medical supplies and equipment intend to serve more patients and provide more comprehensive health care. ","Health and Disease Prevention is an ongoing focus area that aims to combat disease and introduce health initiatives that will improve communities.

Flooding in the Khartoum state of Sudan in September 2013 left communities vulnerable to malaria. In addition to food aid, 400 families received mosquito nets to prevent contraction of malaria. 

In November 2013, The Middle and Lower Shabelle regions of Somalia experienced heavy rainfall and flooding in several areas. Risk of malaria spiked, leaving families susceptible to malaria and waterborne disease. About 3,000 people received mosquito nets as part of flood relief packages.

To  be  able  to  achieve  these  goals,  a  holistic  approach  was used  to  tackle  the  main  difficulties  blocking  both  the  housing  sector,  including  the complexity  of  the  land  tenure  situation,  the  lack  of housing  credit,  weaknesses  in  the construction  industry  and  local  authorities,  high  density  settlements,  no  urban  planning, limited  historical  government  interventions,  and  very  difficult  terrain  prone  to  landslides and  other  natural  risks. UNOPS  engaged  in  three  different  housing  solutions  in  order  to  address  the  issue  of  lack of  housing  in  informal  urban  settlements: Repair  and  reinforcements,  Single  core expandable  houses  and  collective  site.<br><br>The  main  objective  of  this  request  is  to  seek funding  for  the sanitation  component attached  to  the  housing  program.  In  light  of  the  request  of  the Direction  Nationale  de l'Eau  Potable  et  de  l'Assainissement (DINEPA),  the  National  Water  and  Sanitation Agency,  of  having  a  toilet  for  each  new  house  constructed,  the  project  is  in  need  of  350 sanitation  packages  that  include  the  septic  tank  and  related  plumbing  to  finish  the program.  This  would  cater  to  350  families  who  are  in  need  of  housing  in  the  neighborhoods  of  Pétionville  and  Turgeau.

Similar to Dengue fever, symptoms of Chikungunya include roughly two to five days of fever, followed by severe joint pains that may recur interminably. The sub-tropical climate, and periods of increased rainfall (rainy season) have resulted in an increase in mosquito activity, thereby increasing the chances of transmitting the disease.

The project will address and help guarantee women’s access to, use of, and control of productive assets, resources and services. It will also improve the capacity of formal and informal institutions to be more responsive to women’s (and other marginalised groups) priorities & accountable to upholding their rights. WE-RISE will also challenge the negative attitudes and restrictive gender roles in the community, which limit the participation of women in markets and community services. In breaking down these barriers it will give women a greater chance of claiming leadership roles and having their voice heard in the community. The project will also target men and their behaviours and attitudes towards women. Their participation in this project will help uphold the rights of women at the household level and within the entire community. Furthermore, WE-RISE will assist farmers as they adapt to the challenges created by climate change, and enhance their ability to cope with shocks.

Interventions have been selected in agriculture, nutrition, health and gender equality that have a strong evidence base or, where there is no evidence base, where expert opinion endorses their use. The project will utilize the existing evidence base and improve it the where gaps exist through an appropriate project design and ongoing operations research.

Catholic Relief Services (CRS),CRS-NE-14-5020,"",foodsecurity_site,Working in Niger for Disaster Immunity (WINDI),"In August and September 2013, floods hit several areas of the country, washing away crops, homes, and property. This was followed by the premature end of precipitation, which resulted in the drying of crops, particularly cereals, before they could mature. As a result, the Nigerien Ministry of Agriculture projected a deficit of 343,566 MT for this year’s harvest , with 7,506,790 people (46.9% of the population) expected to be suffering from food insecurity by April 2014. Of these, 1,211,352 will be severely food insecure. By November 2013, 44% of households were already implementing crisis coping strategies.

In order to address these ongoing needs, CRS Niger launched a project called Working In Niger for Disaster Immunity (WINDI, which also signifies ""household"" in Zarma) in December 2013 with funds from UNDP, Caritas Australia, CAFOD, and CRS private funds. The departments of Tillabéri, Ouallam, and Téra in Tillabéri Region were targeted due to their long history of food insecurity (statistics reveal that Ouallam has experienced agricultural production deficits every year for the past thirteen years, while Tillabéri has experienced food deficits for ten of the past thirteen years). 

Priority I of WINDI is to ensure immediate food and nutritional security for vulnerable households through Cash-for-Work, food vouchers, and targeted free food distributions. Priority II is to reinforce productive capacities and resilience through vouchers for seeds, post-harvest management, off-season agricultural inputs, and small ruminants, as well as the provision of Moringa seedlings.  ","WINDI began by targeting 900 vulnerable households in Ouallam in a small ruminants and market garden project to restore households’ assets that were lost in flooding and had not benefited from OFDA’s Bonbatu activities, with these activities ending in March 2014. 

Another 300 households are implementing land recovery activities along with activities to reduce risk to flooding in a CFW program for three months, from March to May, intended to give families cash with which to pay back their loans and meet basic needs, rather than selling their harvested food. 

CRS Niger’s continued presence in more villages is requested by the Ouallam authorities, including the prefet and local representatives from various ministries (agriculture, environment, livestock, etc.)",Additional funding sources are being explored for future activities under WINDI.,2014-01-01,2015-01-01,"","Agriculture,Food Aid","",238149,"","",CRS,8400,"",Niger>Tillaberi,Bill Rastetter,Country Representative,bill.rastetter@crs.org,+227-20-72-38-61,"",2014-05-07,2014-05-07,active,"Caritas Australia,Catholic Overseas Development Agency (CAFOD),United Nations Development Program (UNDP)"

The project works with Farm Protection Committees (FPCs) reforming them, using the experience from villages where the committees are functioning well to inform capacity building of new or weak committees. The project also helps improve nutrition through improved awareness of optimal nutrition and preventive practices and this improves access to, and affordability of, diversified foods.

It recognises that in order to maintain and advance a sustained (re)integration of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees to new and former villages, they must be confident that their entry will be peaceful. The project will work by enhancing the communities’ capacity to prevent, mitigate and address conflict between pastoralists and farmers whilst improving mutual access to shared natural resources and livelihood assets. The project will support settled farmer and transient pastoralist communities  to revive traditional conflict mitigation mechanisms, like Farmer Protection Committees (FPCs) and ajawids, and to amplify modified structures, like Youth Committees and Women Unions. Meanwhile, it will also increase the participation of women and youth in grassroots traditional conflict mediation processes. CRS will nurture this revival through practical prevention and mediation skills building; setting up migration notification systems (MNS) co-designed by farmers and pastoralists; galvanizing farmers and pastoralists to assess, identify and propose community initiated projects which focus on inter-community natural resource needs along the migratory route in coordination with the MoA and MoAR; and demarcating and restoring swani  rest areas. In tandem with these activities, CRS will equip farmers and pastoralists with improved natural resource management (NRM) strategies by training a representative cross-section of the community - IDP/returnee/refugee farmers and pastoralists, women, youth, the elderly, the disabled - on how natural resources can help to unite and not divide vulnerable communities.

With an annual budget of $520,000, Episcopal Relief & Development supports programs with Projects Department of the Church that includes NetsforLife® and a clean water program, in Cunene. In 2007 PMI/USAID started to support NetsforLife at Mucaba Municipality in Uige Province, with a total grant of $1,500,000 for five years. <br><br>The Anglican Church with its strong roots in the community, in Uige province and Southern Angola, has successfully shown impact in malaria morbidity and mortality. The result of these discussions was a grant of $308,000 to purchase and distribute long lasting insecticide treated nets through the Anglican Church network.

Episcopal Relief & Development,ERD-AO-14-5508,B51B84EB-3FA6-4E58-8A65-1D1255049BDC,"",Mothers' Union Child Survival & Savings with Education 2014 Diocese of Angola,"2014 Program Goal: The current goal of the Angola Mothers’ Union Child Survival program is to facilitate the transformation and empowerment of Angolan women to reinforce their contribution toward a reduction in the morbidity and mortality of their children, an increase in their economic independence in their families, and an overall improvement in the environment and public health of their communities. <br><br>The 2014-2016 Strategic Plan of the Angola Mothers’ Union Child Survival program targets the formation of 520 Savings with Education Groups throughout five provinces. This 2014 plan therefore proposes to support the Mothers’ Union in their expanded work toward this goal and the growth of the new Savings with Education component of the Child Survival Program through the reinforcement of 56 Savings with Education groups (32 in Luanda and 24 in Uige). Additionally, this plan will ensure the continuation and/or integration of education dialogues on good health, clean environments, violence, gender-based violence, and financial literacy within each and every Savings group. <br><br>Background: Initially launched in 2009 as an extension to the Angola NetsforLife® program, the originally shared goal of the Angola NetsforLife® and Mothers’ Union Child Survival program was to contribute to behavior change and the reduction of child morbidity and mortality in Angola. With recognition to the need for a more integrated response that would address additional childhood vulnerabilities such as contagious diseases, poor nutrition, and limited prenatal care, the Child Survival program was launched to empower (educate and enable) women to improve the health of children in their households as well as their communities. <br><br>In response to a January 2011 assessment, the Bishop of the Anglican Church of Angola approved that the leadership of the Child Survival Program be transferred to the Mothers’ Union and their newly formed project department, so as to ensure the project’s more intensive and effective engagement. As Public Health depends upon all (the whole population) being educated and engaged, not simply the members of the Anglican Church parishes and congregations, in 2011 under the Mothers’ Union leadership the project took on a new structure. This change charged the Mothers’ Union with the task of educating its members, who in turn would voluntarily work to educate the community. <br><br>Over the next three years (2011 – 2013) 27 Mothers’ Union members were trained as facilitators (Community Agents). These Community Agents in turn mobilized and trained over 1,173 Mothers’ Union members as volunteer Activists that in turn engaged women in their neighborhoods to create community-based Learning Groups. Over the three-year period it was reported that 4,129 women in 55 communities of Luanda, Uige and Mucaba districts had formed 608 Learning Groups to discuss issues of better child health. <br><br>As of 2013, over 2,198 women in 291 learning groups were still meeting weekly to not only discuss but also take action on issues that would contribute to better health in their homes, among their group members, and in their wider communities. In 2012/3, to improve responsiveness of the program to meet women’s additional requests for economic strengthening, the Mothers’ Union began researching the integration of a savings group component. This initially involved a March 2012 peer learning exchange with Mothers’ Union Burundi, followed by a November 2012 Savings with Education Facilitators’ Workshop led by Episcopal Relief & Development technical partner Freedom from Hunger. <br><br>In 2013, this new Savings with Education component was launched in Luanda by 7 newly trained Mothers’ Union Savings Agents. The pilot year results were the creation of 12 Savings Groups (through the combination of 28 learning groups) inclusive of 233 active members who saved a combined total of US$29,683 and earned a combined total of US$3,889 in benefits (interest and fines) for an end-of-year payout of US$33,572 (i.e., representing an average of US$144 per member).","""1.1 FORM: Promote the formation of Savings Groups among existing women’s Health Learning Groups and other community and faith-based groups in Luanda and Uige."",""1.2 FACILITATE: Facilitate Savings Groups to create 7 Rules and begin regular savings, lending and financial management tasks."",""1.3 INTEGRATE: Encourage Savings Groups to continue with FASA discovery dialogues that integrate into group meetings an opportunity for education on health.

1) Microcredit Service: To facilitate 60 entrepreneurs decapitalized by the 2010 earthquake to have access to credit at a preferred interest rate of 2.5% with the intent to contribute to the restarting or growth of their economic activities by at least 35% within a period of 6 months;

As a Body that has a huge constituency of congregations, the action will thus make use of the numbers to spread the positive effects expected as outcomes. Different strategies will be used for particularly the young people (young men and women) and women who tend to be ‘invisible’ and thus left out. By creating separate and later common spaces for these groups, CAPA hopes to capture all the voices and ideas necessary to reach the desired outcomes. CAPA’s strategy and approach is based on the recommendations and outcomes from the All Africa Bishops’ Conference held in 2010 where among other themes, the following were agreed upon as focus areas: i.

Agricultural production is the main source of food for more than 85% of households in these communities and a key source of household income, despite the area’s chronic cycle of flooding and drought. Through 2012 support from ASA, farmers have tackled the hard task of building damns and/or re-opening colonial drainage and irrigation canal systems in their river valleys. With the opening of these drainage and irrigation systems, farmers are now able to increase their control of their natural water resources and prevent chronic devastation that occurs from seasonal droughts and floods.



In 2013, through voluntary participation in village-level agriculture associations, farmers will be engaged in new planting, processing and storing techniques, as well as animal husbandry. As such, farmers anticipate increasing their commercial production of marketable products such as maize, rice, vegetables, chickens and pigs, as well as their popular crops of cassava, sweet potatoes and beans.

Additionally, during 2013, ECP will work with several communities to implement the plans they came up with through ABCD processes last year. These include establishing a livelihood fund for women in Sitio Batasan after successful completion of their post-harvest facility work in 2012, and building a potable water system through collaboration with the local government in Ambangeg.  The program will also work to setup a drying pavement for coconut meat and a cattle-fattening program to add sales value and increase incomes, with a community in Upper Latap. In Santa Clara, the community decided to build on their assets through the construction of a drying area for grains, the acquisition of a mini-feed mill, and by starting organic fertilizer production. And in Nueva Ecija, households will be working together to start small-scale business ventures identified during their ABCD process. 



Finally, in Isabela, one of the biggest rice growing areas in the country, the program will be trialing a new system for growing rice, called the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), which has been shown to lead to improved harvests, lower costs and greater resilience to climate stresses like heavy rains.

Malaria continues to be the leading causes of morbidity, mortality and economic loss and the recent outbreak of cholera in 2012  resulted in a large number of deaths of especially children. Not being able to grow enough food to eat and sell poses a threat to the marginalized, especially women, children and youth. This, coupled with a rise in violence against women has left communities feeling vulnerable and without strong leadership. As a church, the Anglican Diocese of Bo feels obliged to face these challenges. Supporting the initiatives of the Government of Sierra Leone in fighting poverty, malaria and violence, the Diocese will be addressing these issues through an integrated program focused on good governance and leadership training, preventative health, and increasing community food supply in Pujehun and Bo districts.



Specifically the Diocese is supporting communities to grow enough food to eat and sell, with the introduction of large scale farming through organized community groups on community land. The indirect results will be seen in the form of environmental protection, increased income, and leadership of women.

Saving for Change was jointly developed by Freedom from Hunger, Oxfam America and Strømme Foundation.<br><br>Self-selecting groups of approximately 20 women come together and, over several weeks, make decisions about the management of their savings groups, with guidance from a trained field agent. The members elect a management committee and make decisions within a framework provided by the program, including their group name, social objective, savings amount, lending policies, cycle length, fines for infractions, etc. The field agent also trains the group on how to manage their meetings. Members save a set amount at every meeting, and periodically borrow from their pooled savings to meet their investment or consumption needs. Loans are repaid with interest, allowing the group fund to grow more quickly. Funds are only accessed during meetings in the presence of all members, and are kept in a locked cashbox between meetings. Savings meetings can last as little as 15 minutes, while saving and lending meetings can last up to an hour. Annually, members divide the group fund in proportion to their savings contribution, take stock of their achievements, and decide what changes to make as they begin a new cycle.<br><br>In order for groups to manage meetings autonomously, without field agent oversight, the group record-keeping system for Saving for Change is adapted to the literacy and numeracy level of group members. In West Africa, an entirely memory-based system allows all members to validate transactions transparently. In Latin America, written records allow more flexible savings deposits and more complex lending policies.<br><br>Group meetings also allow for discussion of group and community issues, and for education sessions. The field agent facilitates a 30-minute learning session during some group meetings, using the same skills necessary for establishing the members’ self-management of their group. For this reason, the preparation of the field agent to provide education only requires additional training on the content of the sessions. The content for these learning sessions is available from Freedom from Hunger, which eliminates the need for institutions to invest in costly development of their own materials. The same field agent who monitors the group’s activities can deliver learning sessions, keeping marginal costs low, or a dedicated staff may do so, allowing for greater specialization but increasing delivery costs.","Freedom from Hunger supports organizations worldwide in implementing Saving for Change by offering training workshops and support services in the following areas:<br><li>Implementation planning<li>Formation of savings groups<li>Replication of savings groups<li>Training of trainers in education module content<li>Supervision of savings groups and education services<li>Installation of a management information system<br><br>In addition, Freedom from Hunger supports institutions that implement other types of savings group programming in integrating education services. ","In many parts of the world, the very poor and particularly those living in isolated, rural areas have limited access to formal financial services. Rather than offer financial services, institutions that implement Saving for Change promote self-managed financial services. A wide range of nongovernmental organizations with experience in community development, health, literacy or agriculture can help the populations they serve access basic saving and lending services, without needing the systems and processes of financial service institutions. Furthermore, Saving for Change

Freedom from Hunger,FFH-ZA-89-2068,"","",Credit with Education,"Credit with Education is a methodology for group-based poverty lending integrated with simple, relevant, high-impact learning in better business management, health, and family financial management. This model builds on the village banking methodology by integrating financial services and dialogue-based adult education typically using the same field agent to deliver both services. <br><br>Freedom from Hunger’s method of implementing village banking depends on active participation by the clients. Members are expected to manage the individual and group accounting functions, the assessment and determination of loan applications, the meeting procedures, and the solution/decision-making for problems and issues that arise in the normal functioning of their village banks.  Field agents are specifically trained to facilitate the process.  The education, or learning session, is delivered in a 20-30-minute segment in the course of each regular village bank meeting.  The field agent facilitates the session using the same skills necessary for establishing clients’ self-management of their group.  For this reason, the preparation of the field agent to serve as the facilitator of the education only requires additional training on the content of the sessions.<br><br>The content for these learning sessions is available from Freedom from Hunger, thereby eliminating the need for institutions to invest in costly development of their own materials.  Because a single field agent delivers both the education and financial services, the marginal costs of providing the education are low.  Because the education sessions are kept short, the field agents are able to attend to the same number of groups as field agents not offering education.<br><br>Institutions may also choose to offer education through staff dedicated specifically to this purpose.  Although this is a higher cost strategy, it still takes advantage of the groups’ regular meetings and allows for the specialization of staff.","Over the past two decades, Freedom from Hunger has developed training and technical assistance packages to support organizations in implementing Credit with Education.  These packages are designed for two types of institutions:<br><li>Institutions already offering a group-based lending product that wish to integrate education<li>Institutions with experience in individual lending that wish to begin a group-based lending product with education.<br><br>Freedom from Hunger currently offers workshops on the following topics:<br><li>Integration and implementation of education<li>Supervision of integrated Credit with Education programs<li>Training of trainers in education module content<li>Design of Credit with Education product<li>Credit with Education Loan Officer training<li>Evaluation of outcomes

Global Health Action,GHA-CN-07-5070,"","children,China,emotional development,left-behind children,reproductive health",Adolescence Health Education Promotion for Left-behind Children in China,"With the changing economic climate in China where jobs are often found in cities, the urban migrant or “floating” population has increased dramatically. In 2009, the floating population in China reached 211 million adults who left their permanent homes in rural parts of the country to seek temporary jobs in urban areas.  This migration leaves over 58 million children in homes far from their parents. Further trends show that migrants in China tend to stay longer in their current work location, resulting in a need for expanded care and services for left-behind children in the rural areas where the family home is located.

Today in China, GHA is collaborating on projects with a number of partners to expand health care in Chinese communities to implement the Left-Behind Children Project in rural areas in China.  With the support of our donors, GHA has begun the implementation of this project to train local health leaders and community-based health educators in an innovative program to advance the health, social & life skills, and well-being of youth in rural China.

The Left-Behind Children Project is a GHA partnership initiative that works to develop an adolescent health education program to improve the access to information, psycho-social support, and health care for vulnerable youth in China.  GHA acts to help marginalized Chinese girls and boys, ages 11 to 15, to manage the health and development issues adolescents face during puberty.   The project targets children, living in rural Funing County in Jiangsu Province, whose parents left to pursue livelihoods in cities, unable to return regularly.  These youth face challenges of growing up and changing without the support of their parents who, traditionally in China, are the main source available to provide important health education and guidance through key life choices.

The purpose of this project within the over-all program is to build the capacities of community health providers such as traditional birth attendants (TBAs) to fulfill their roles and responsibilities related to the above-mentioned strategies.

Training Health Providers:
A core of health providers already exists in the Petit-Goâve  commune – a total of 21 CHWs (community health workers) and 61 TBAs who have been trained, supported and updated by GHA with varying degrees of support from local partners. Working in partnership with other on-the-ground organizations, GHA will support their work as community-based health educators and health providers. That on-going support will include continuing education during regular monthly meetings and additional week-long refresher training workshops on key topics such as maternal and child health, recognizing danger symptoms in pregnant women and safe delivery methods. 

","Specific to this project, there will be 10 TBA meetings, involving 64 TBAs in total.

There will be two week-long continuing education sessions on topics related to maternal and child health (64 TBAs will be split into two groups, each participating in one week-long session) led by experienced Haitian trainers and supervisors.

Providing primary care:

GHA will continue to equip and support the TBAs to provide home-based pre-natal care, delivery, and post-natal care in their rural communities. They will also refer women to clinics and hospitals when there are pregnancy danger signs. TBAs will provide on-going care to pregnant women in their communities. On average, each TBA will deliver 24-30 babies a year.

While the livestock farmers will receive knowledge and skills in goat care, the community leaders will gain basic competencies to provide veterinary services to their community members. By facilitating capacity-building workshops for both livestock farmers and leaders, providing veterinary supplies and seed capital (in the form of a breeding buck), GHA will have established a network of women livestock farmers and women Animal Health Workers (AHWs) from the mountainous and under-served sections of the commune. Women livestock farmers, especially those with goats, will have easy and affordable access to veterinary services within their communities. Access to these services at the community-level will tackle rural poverty (and through it, reduce hunger) in the following ways: 
	Improve the knowledge and skills of female livestock farmers in animal husbandry;
	Provide non-cash assets to the farmers to build and improve household income; 
	Foster a network of women AHWs to cater to the needs of the women livestock farmers;
	Reduce household expenditures related to livestock maintenance;
	Reduce travel time and efforts to seek veterinary services that have hitherto only been available in the nearest town; and
	Improve the health and wellness of the livestock, thereby commanding a better sale price in the market. 
","The goal of this project is to improve long-term household income security of women livestock farmers by 
i.	Improving skills and knowledge of women livestock farmers in goat care and husbandry, 
ii.	Providing the farmers with an asset (female goat crossed with an improved breeding buck),
iii.	Making available low to no-cost veterinary services through a network of newly trained & supported women AHWs in the Leogane commune of Haiti, and 
iv.	Ensuring that the improved offspring of the pregnant goat reaches appropriate saleable age in good health, thereby maximizing the farmers’ financial return when they are sold at market.

Within the framework of the first phase of the project, more than 110 families have benefitted from their involvement, which helped participant families increase their income and be able to pay for their children’s education. The project participant families received beehives and established small bee farms. They have sold the produced honey, and the revenue was used to pay the tuition and fees of their children enrolled in Giteliq University. After the interim evaluation of the project’s impact, Giteliq University proposed to Heifer Armenia the second phase of the project. The goal of this second phase is to support rural families in the Yeghegis, Getap and Agarakadzor communities of Vayots Dzor. Participants will be families who already have children enrolled or who have children planning to receive higher education during the project period, and the project will help insure a source of sustainable income that will allow a total of 150 resource-poor families—both original and Pass on the Gift (POG)—to pay the tuition and fees for their children. The project will also improve the nutrition of participating families. To achieve these goals, the university will provide the project with 250 bee families. In the spring of 2011, 50 families will receive 250 beehives and will establish small bee farms. The income from the production of honey will be directed to pay for the education fees of project participant students. Two cycles of POG (every two years) are planned for the lifetime of the project, which will add 100 new families to the project.

Heifer International,HEFI-AM-11-3866,27-0525-12,foodsecurity_site,Animal Health Management in Cross-Border Areas of Armenia and Georgia,"Animal Health Management in Cross-Border Areas of Armenia and Georgia

This project perfectly merges with the Armenian and Georgian government strategies on strengthening of cross-border economic links and creation of private veterinary services that will complement government action on prevention of animal diseases.

The project will ultimately benefit the rural population in the target areas, through improvement of animal husbandry and health control practices and, therefore providing better conditions for their economic activities.

The direct benefits expected from this project are:

1. 60 veterinarians in rural communities in the bordering villages of northern Armenia and southern Georgia effectively advocate on the prevention and control of animal infection diseases.

2. Rural communities of Shirak and Lori marzes in Armenia and Samtskhe-Javakheti and Kvemo-Kartli provinces in Georgia effectively prevent and control animal diseases and promote livestock sector development practices through application of new techniques and establishment of veterinary health care services through Service Centres (two Centres to be established in Armenia; two health care units within existing Centres to be established in Georgia).

The core concept of making new models replicable is to demonstrate their veterinary applicability that attracts veterinary business interests to the project beneficiaries and also stakeholders.

We believe that the proposed project is commercially applicable as there is a market demand in high quality vet services and for consistent access to farm output markets. However, under the current underdeveloped farm management system, with limited financial inflows and lack of trained vets in the regions, this demand is currently impossible to fulfill.

Successful implementation of Animal Health (AH) demonstrations will open opportunities and attract business incentives of the private sector to invest in similar business models in Armenia and Georgia, which will ensure continues action in this field.","The target areas of the present project cover Armenian and Georgian bordering regions, namely, Shirak and Lori marzes in Armenia and Samtskhe-Javakheti and Kvemo-Kartli regions in Georgia. 

There are direct and indirect beneficiaries identified for the project: the direct or immediate target groups are Community veterinarians; and the indirect or secondary target groups are Community members and farmers. 

The direct target groups, i.e. those who will get Training of Trainers (ToT) training, will be 15 veterinarians from each region. The trained 60 veterinarians will train small and medium farmers. The secondary beneficiaries will be identified with the help of trained veterinarians. This group will be composed of 100 farmers per region, i.e. indirect target group will be formed by 400 farmers both in Armenia and Georgia. 
Within the frames of the project two Farm Service Centres will be established in Armenia and two veterinary service units will be set-up on the basis of already existing Farmer Service Centers in Georgia, through which sustainable veterinary health care services will be provided in the bordering regions of Armenia and Georgia (see details section A 2.1). Location of the veterinary health care services will be identified considering their geographic position towards neighbouring villages. This means, one veterinary health service will be established in every target region serving several surrounding communities/settlements.

Gender issues: Women play a very significant role in the rural economies of Armenia and Georgia, providing 40% of the workforce and heading a third of rural households. The project will encourage participation of women farmers that are actively involved in animal husbandry activities (animal care, milking, feeding, etc.). Accordingly, the project will systematically take gender considerations into account as a matter of priority. Particularly, the project will: (a) assure that eligible poor rural women will be made fully aware of and fully access the benefits available under the project: (b) at least a third of farm households to be targeted will be woman-headed; (c) mainstream gender into the project management; (d) identify the best development methods to support poor rural women.

In order to overcome these problems, this project will promote the sustainable management of natural resources; the implementation of agricultural production systems on family and communal plots, including increasing and diversifying production; the marketing of surplus agricultural products; small-farmer organizational strengthening, including developing knowledge, skills and capacities for management and lobbying; and public policy advocacy at municipal and departmental levels. Participants will include 580 original families from 20 communities representing 12 small-farming organizations. Families will receive cows, goats and poultry, agricultural inputs and knowledge regarding agroecological systems management.

Heifer International,HEFI-BO-11-3810,23-1142-02,foodsecurity_site,Developing Food Systems for Small Farmer and Indigenous Families in the Bolivian Amazon (Oriente),"Over the last several years, Heifer International Bolivia has been building strategic alliances with rural and indigenous organizations to implement projects oriented toward building sustainable livelihoods and food systems; creating a collaborative network supporting clean agricultural production; increasing access to and control over natural resources; increasing access to and interaction with markets; facilitating organization-building; shaping public policy; and improving gender equity. 

Indigenous and rural families in Bolivia’s “Oriente” (eastern region), in coordination with Heifer Bolivia and other strategic allies have identified concrete problems affecting their food security and livelihoods. These problems are vulnerability to production systems; weak leadership in rural and indigenous organizations, limiting their ability to address new food security and climate change challenges; and lack of effective public policies assuring food security and adaptation to climate change. Heifer Bolivia and its partners will implement the Developing Food Systems for Small Farmer and Indigenous Families in the Bolivian Amazon (Oriente) Project to help address these issues.

Rural and indigenous communities in the Amazon-Chiquitana eco-regions, in the provinces of Velasco, Mojos, M Marbán, Cercado, Vaca Diez and Ballivian in the departments of Santa Cruz and Beni, respectively, are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change on agricultural production, as well as on socio-cultural and environmental systems. Droughts, floods, changing agricultural patterns, and other effects of climate change distress agricultural and environmental resources. As a result, the food sources are compromised, exacerbating poverty and hunger for these communities. In the last few years, rural and indigenous people have begun to claim their individual and collective rights regarding access to land, natural resources and local power. These reclaimed responsibilities challenge them to develop integrated resource management strategies that will help advance their food security and sovereignty amidst the effects of climate change. Unfortunately, as stated above, limited organizational capacity hinders their ability to develop the necessary plans, proposals and other tools that will allow for the sustainable development of these communities.

This project will develop mechanisms to structurally address the causes of the above-mentioned problems and achieve the objective of improving sustainable food systems of indigenous and rural families by strengthening economic agricultural production and socio-organizational and advocacy capacities. The project will work with 2,783 families, of which 1,480 will receive original resources. The remaining 1,303 families will receive resources through Heifer’s Pass on the Gift (POG) model. Through POG, original families share the offspring of animals or other resources received, including training, with another family in the project. 

Participating families live in the departments of Beni and Santa Cruz. By the end of the project, 2,783 indigenous and rural families will have diversified their food supply sources and increase their income generation by 20 percent, using 70 percent of their produce for family consumption. They will implement 1,484 acres of agroforestry systems (including 988 acres of wild cacao), 31 modules of hair sheep, 600 family units of hens and eight modules of fish (with additional support to 10 modules of fish previously distributed). Training will be provided in natural resource management, food security, climate change awareness and adaptation, new and ancestral farming technologies, and transformation and marketing. Seventy-one indigenous and rural communities will establish transparent and accountable systems, establish internal democratic mechanisms and have improved ability to represent their interest, allowing them to promote their food security agendas. Five indigenous and rural umbrella-community organizations will facilitate the adoption (at the municipal and departmental government levels) of public policy on food security and sovereignty and climate change adaptation.

Today, there are more than 3,000 remaining Quilombo communities, made of ancestors of the slaves, or Quilombolas. More than half of these communities are in the northeast, and many maintain the cultural traditions from their African roots. Most Quilombolas do not have their territory recognized or have proper conditions to work and make a living, even though laws exist to guarantee them those rights. Consequently, many Quilombo communities suffer from food insecurity resulting from interference of plantations that seize the best land and destroy local vegetation by practicing conventional agriculture, accelerating soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. The Quilombola Community of Conceição das Crioulas is in the semi-arid region of Pernambuco. The estimated 4,000 inhabitants survive basically by family agriculture and handicrafts. The partnership with Heifer will benefit 170 original families and 250 families by passing on the gift, and will reinforce their production systems on the basis of agroecology, support training and contribute to better-coordinated advocacy for suitable public policies. The project will also work to recover territory and reinforce ethnic and gender equity.

Such a disconnected food system is vulnerable to the shocks and stresses of the global market, putting farmers at financial risk, and often leaving eaters without access to wholesome food for sustenance, health and pride in culture and identity. Heifer International’s Re-visioning the Manitoba Harvest (RVMH): Fostering Localized Food Systems for Farmers and Eaters brings together families from rural, northern and urban regions of the province to build collaborative solutions to hunger, poverty and the loss of food traditions and skills. ","The RVMH project will assist 52 farm families in improving net income by increasing access to local markets. The project will also enable 240 Newcomer, Indigenous and northern families to restore food traditions by providing living resources and training. Finally, the project will increase local food consumption by engaging 200 urban families in gardening and food advocacy. By sharing resources and training to an additional 492 families, these activities will foster a local food system that is sustained by the active co-operation of farmers and eaters.

It is also expected that the levels of hunger will reduce by improving nutrition through the availability and affordability of protein in the diets of project beneficiaries. The five year project will benefit a total of 1270 farm families of 10160 people who are members of 30 Common Initiative Groups (CIGs). Within the target communities 195 farm families will be assisted every year for the first three years of project implementation. By the end of the fifth year the project will be working with 1270 families. The original placement of livestock will include 700 pigs and 1740 sheep. The 700 pigs will be distributed as follows: 100 families will receive 400 pigs (4 each) to engage in pig fattening for marketing and another 100 families will receive 300 pigs (3 each- 2 gilts and 1 boar) to engage in breeding. 1740 mature sheep will be distributed to 435 families (4 per family). All the original placement farm families will in turn pass on to the same number of families. In order to reduce drudgery in farming 339 families will receive one donkey each and the cost of each donkey will be repaid into the group revolving fund rather passed-on to enable them buy donkeys for the remaining group members. The expansion of the Heifer program into the Far North was first conceptualized in 2003 when the current strategic plan was written. It was determined at the time that in order for Heifer Cameroon to make real impact throughout the country it was imperative to work in the area that houses 40% of the country's population and the bulk of the nation's poverty. Sahelian in ecology the Far north poses a new challenge to Heifer Cameroon because of its geography and socio-ecological as well as cultural context. The Project will enable project partners to improve their organizational capacity and gender relations improve productivity of crops and livestock improve access to potable water for human and animal use improve storage techniques processing and marketing of products improve sustainable interaction with the environment enhance household food security and generate supplemental income. It will improve gender relations and mitigate the effects of HIV & AIDS at household and community levels in partnership with existing projects by providing training the gift of livestock and building capacities in project beneficiaries to improve their productivity and sustain the project's benefits beyond the active funded life of the project. The project participants will provide land labor and on-farm construction materials. Each beneficiary farm family will contribute 40% costs of agricultural supplies into the revolving fund of their respective groups to enhance its financial sustainability after external funding has ended. It is expected that through the POG approach more resource-limited families and community members will increase their food production and improve their security thereby contributing to the success of the Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Government of Cameroon for this area.,"","",2008-07-01,2015-06-30,"",Agriculture,"","","","","","","",Cameroon>Far North,Khristina Strobel,Program Assistant,Khristina.Strobel@heifer.org,"",http://www.heifer.org,2014-01-13,2014-07-08,active,""

This area has a severe water deficit that hinders agricultural and livestock activities. Additionally, the small farmers in the area do not have sufficient irrigation systems and need to strengthen their organizational processes, especially to obtain access to water and the right to irrigate to improve production. Since agroecological production and water use are so closely linked, it is fundamental that both issues be addressed together. This project will support 410 people by improving their organizations and agroecological production. Specifically, the project will establish access to irrigation; provide ongoing training for 298 families from the three Cayambe communities; and build three communal reservoirs, two siphons and an aspersion irrigation system. These resources will contribute to the improvement of participating families’ production of healthy foods. Additionally, the project will foster the further development of agroecology by establishing 112 agroecological production units with irrigation.

This canton is the poorest in the country, with a poverty index of 92.9 percent, and is pioneering through its municipality a model of participatory management.  One of the greatest problems faced on these farms is the soil, which has a high concentration of calcium, but is poor in nutrients. Farmers must buy a lot of organic fertilizer and other inputs. They also lack access to infrastructure for irrigation on their plots and marketing channels to sell their surplus produce, so their primary economic strategy is to sell their labor in urban areas. These problems will be addressed by implementing an agroecological approach to recover soil fertility using a series of agroecological techniques, producing organic fertilizer and working for soil conservation; implementing different productive micro-enterprises to improve families’ income; and strengthening the community socio-organization through a process of training and coaching leaders in their public actions in the canton working with the municipality.

Significant problems faced by families practicing agroforestry include the lack of irrigation infrastructure for their production plots, low levels of production and insufficient capacity to invest to improve production. Additionally, the organization lacks adequate communication and linkage between its various levels. In response to these difficulties, Heifer Ecuador will promote the rational use of soil and water and proper handling of product diversification and intercropping, collective marketing to increase income, and socio-organizational strengthening through training of leaders and administrators.

In the Ecuadorian territory, 5% offshore of areas being considered wasteland one of several ecosystems that are part of the ecological diversity of a small country, but it has a greater environmental and biological variety than other countries. The climatic conditions in the Sierra have spurred an interesting development of the same plant species characterizing the beautiful landscapes of the area known as paramo. The region is ideal for deer, condors,  hummingbirds and colorful flowers. The key feature of the moors is to store and distribute water they receive from rainfall and melting of snow and ice can be found above. Most of the water resources of Ecuador are derived from this ecosystem.

Out of these, 376 will receive original placements of livestock, poultry and beehives; while 1,064 will benefit through Heifer’s Pass on the Gift (POG) process. The majority of these families are subsistence farmers, growing food crops and keeping indigenous livestock. The targeted communities are faced with high levels of poverty, unable to acquire or access basic needs such as food, shelter and education. This situation is a result of endemic low productivity of crops and livestock, limited market access, low non-farm incomes, and poor social and communications infrastructures. Poverty here is manifested in the high malnutrition rates (especially in children), poor housing, inability of parents to pay school fees and medical bills, credit unworthiness, high rural-urban migration, child labor and unemployment. This project will provide participating families with sustainable livelihoods, including the creation of additional income-generating opportunities and market linkages. To do this, Heifer will distribute 500 beehives with honey harvesting equipment to 100 families (five beehives per family) and 480 sheep/goats to 96 families (one male and four females per family). Participants will be trained in animal husbandry and beekeeping. A total of 3,600 laying hens will also be distributed to 180 families (20 per family). This project will also seek to address other capacity development issues and the inability of small-scale farmers to access financial credit by linking participants to financial institutions (banks, micro-credit institutions).","Theoretical and hands-on training in Beekeeping, small ruminant and poultry production.

The project will be implemented in the six communities of Naafa, Bombalanyuro, Korapuo, Kukunya, Nahayizire and Nyanyama. These communities are located in the newly
created district of Sawla-Tuna-Kalba of the Northern Region of Ghana. The primary goal of this project is to enhance the livelihoods of people in the targeted communities through the creation of sustainable food production systems. To do this, the project will focus on a) human capital development by honing the knowledge and skills of the project participants; b) rejuvenation of the degraded vegetative cover through tree planting and bushfire-awareness creation, alongside the adoption of appropriate and sustainable agricultural practices; and c) wealth creation through a process whereby participating families are given living loans of livestock and resources that will help them build tangible and financial assets. Heifer will distribute 500 meat sheep and goats to 100 families (five sheep/goats per family in a ratio of one male to four females), 90 local pigs to 30 households (three pigs per family in a ratio of one male to two females), and 1,300 local chickens to 130 families (10 chickens per family in a ratio of nine hens to one cock). A total of 6,660 seedlings of various tree species will also be distributed. Some of these, such as mangoes, will provide food and income; others will serve as windbreaks, shade trees and sources of fuel. Shea butter extraction is a common occupation in this area and has been identified as an enterprise opportunity for women in the project. It is labor-intensive and can be time consuming. This project, therefore, will partner with the Ecumenical Church Loan Fund (ECLOF) to connect participants with microenterprise opportunities. Heifer will also work to ease the drudgery associated with shea butter extraction by providing three shea nut roasters and three shea nut crushers to the project participants.

This project involves men and women as heads of household who develop activities and will share the fruits of their labor with their families.

The strategy to strengthen conservation of biodiversity will be to establish agroforestry systems, integrating fruit trees, legumes, fodder bushes and pasture grasses that can improve soil fertility, pollination of crops and water quality, acting as carbon sinks and reducing erosion by water. The project will establish protection plans for nine water recharge zones and water sources identified as the most important. By the end of the project, 50 percent of the participating families will have water available to meet their basic needs. At least 595 acres will be under agroforestry production. The project will establish 1,000 family food gardens with diverse crops including basic grains, vegetables, fruits and bees to diversify families’ diets. Thirty-five families will engage in beekeeping, with inputs from the project. A total of 179 families will be trained to improve their poultry production (79 families with ducks and 100 with chickens). Field schools will be set up, as participatory learning is very successful in increasing availability of food in communities.

This has a negative impact on the nutrition and health of the population, especially in vulnerable groups like women who are pregnant or nursing, children under age 5 (40 percent suffer inadequate growth, 60 percent malnutrition, 37 percent acute malnutrition) and children who are growing and receiving early education. The infant mortality rate in the project’s area is increasingly higher than in other municipalities (28 deaths per 1,000 births). 

Strengths and opportunities in the project’s zone of intervention are significant and mainly related to the region’s productive potential. The area’s varied climate and quality soils in certain areas allows for the production of vegetables, high altitude fruits, coffee and basic grains.","Based on this situation, Heifer International’s Honduras country program will work with 1,974 families (1,000 original and 974 through Passing on the Gift) to improve the health and nutritional food security of project families. Proposed interventions include: 

1) Increasing access to mother and child health care services
2) Improving access to and consumption of vitamins and minerals through production diversification and sale of surplus to generate income, based on agroecological practices
3) Improving physical and health conditions in the homes of highly vulnerable, poor families
4) Promoting coordination with organizations related to municipal development with the aim to adopt national food security policies and best practices at a municipal level.

Inputs for this project include: 202 cows, 65 goats, 3,975 hens, 8,000 fish fingerlings, 74 beehives, pasture seeds and vegetative material, establishment and management of four fruit trees nurseries, medicines for veterinary medicine chests, tools, medical equipment, construction of 110 improved ecostoves, 11 irrigation systems, 18 biodigesters, improvement of 100 homes and purchase of four anthropometric devices, or devices that take measurements of the size, weight and proportions of the human body. Integrated farms will also be established.

Trainings for families participating in the project include the following topics: health, advocacy, production, agroecology, animal health, organization, administration, basic sanitation, agroecology and others.

Strengthening Production Systems and Improving Basic Conditions for the Lenca Indigenous Population in Western Honduras will be carried out during the course of 4.5 years (2012 to 2016).

It will be located in two areas identified as key territories in Central America: El Trifinio and Northern Nicaragua--known as the buffer zone of the Bosawas Reserve . Most of the population in these territories live in hillsides in a state of food insecurity and vulnerability with insufficient food production to meet their basic needs; suffering from generalized extreme poverty which is reflected by the population's low human development indicators. There are limited opportunities for generating and diversifying income as well as limited access to new sources of employment. The areas are important reserves of natural resources and water sources which are highly vulnerable to climate change.

Heifer International,HEFI-HN-13-4784,23-5002-15,foodsecurity_site,GANASOL 2: Sustainable Agriculture and Livestock on Hillsides in Lempira in Honduras,This five year project is a partnership between HEIFER International (Guatemala and Honduras branch Offices) with the Association of Organizations of the Cuchumatanes (ASOCUCH) in Huehuetenango Guatemala and with the Rural Reconstruction Program (PRR) and the Beans Research Project of the Pan-American Agricultural School - El Zamorano both in Honduras. GANASOL 2 overall goal is to contribute to reduce poverty hunger and vulnerability of 1331 rural families living in the altiplano high plateau by recovering and conserving genetic resources (basic grains and potatoes) and sustainably growing foods in the middle highlands in Guatemala and Honduras. The project's specific objectives are: 1) Increase the resiliency to climate change by implementing agroecological practices and conservation of agro diversity 2) Strengthen food security through diversification by recovering conserving and strengthening the zone's genetic resources (corn beans manioc yams potatoes bananas etc. that will significantly decrease dependence on external seeds and adapted to the zone permanently. In addition families will increase their capacities in the production of plant and animal species (sheep for wool dual-purpose poultry) that will contribute to diversify the family diet and serve as an additional income from selling surplus production; and 3) Strengthen social capital of the producer organizations in Honduras and Guatemala to promote agrobiodiversity food security and organizational sustainability. The project will be located in the municipalities of San Andrés and Santa Cruz where the main livelihoods are basic grains (corns and beans) and small livestock. Meanwhile in Guatemala's highland region in the Cuchumatanes located at 2 500 masl the basic staple in people's diet is potatoes rather than corn. On the Cuchumatanes plateau for several generations the people have produced potatoes and sheep. This is their only livelihood and they face adversities including extreme climate conditions: killing frost drought changing rainfall patterns and hail. Farmers using this production system (sheep + potatoes + forestry) number about 4 270 families. The grazing area on the highlands plateau of the Cuchumatanes is quite large 78 000 hectares but threatens to encroach on the forest. In addition in both countries access to foods has been affected by decreasing purchasing power lack of employment and low wages. Heifer along with PRR Zamorano and ASOCUCH are bringing together their expertise in the GANASOL 2 Project. Heifer in its work in Central America knows the territories local partners as well as the municipal government authorities and community leaders. In addition Heifer has a vast experience in food security through family agriculture and livestock production with agroecological focus natural resources management and values-based development emphasizing the Passing-on-the-Gift and Gender equity. In Guatemala the producer organizations (associations and cooperatives) will be consolidated by setting up Biodiversity Management and Conservation Committees (CDMs) which will belong to the seven grassroots organizations of ASOCUCH who will promote the gender approach and adequate management of the environment and natural resources in the project's territory of intervention. ASOCUCH has broad experience in production to counteract the food deficit and develop the production system (potatoes+sheep+forestry) promoting the access and participation to men and women to make it more efficient to improve food availability and generate economic income to enhance access to foods by organizing sales of potatoes and sheep to supply the local market. ASOCUCH will implement and provide technical advisory assistance with ample experience in Conserving and Developing Agro biodiversity and create six corn seed banks with seeds available to begin the process of dissemination to increase production on farmers' fields. In Honduras community organizations will be reinforced through the Local Agricultural Research Committees (CIALs) using the methodology developed by the Participatory Research Project (IPRA) by CIAT applying an 8-step methodology. During GANASOL 2 the Association of 15 CIALs in Lempira (ASOCIALEM) will be strengthened. The Rural Reconstruction Program (PRR) will be the Technical Advisor in this component due to its experience in basic grain production forming CIALs as a strategy in methodological management and conservation of agro biodiversity.

Heifer International,HEFI-HT-12-3614,23-1418-02,foodsecurity_site,REACH: Rural Entrepreneurs for Agricultural Cooperation in Haiti,"Rural Haitians struggle to survive as farmers under challenging conditions—meager yields due to infertile soils and lack of quality inputs, restricted access to markets because of poor roads and low production quality, and ill health due to high disease rates and limited health services. These conditions have prevailed throughout Haiti’s history and have condemned a majority of its population to abject poverty. On top of this chronic food insecurity, the recent earthquake and hurricanes erased any shreds of resiliency from the already weakened and anemic rural communities. Homes, schools, churches, and stores toppled; crops were wiped out; and roads and bridges were washed away. Critically, livestock were destroyed, leaving rural households without the means to finance their own recovery. In effect, their savings accounts were depleted.  Restoring these savings through the sustainable replenishment and production of crops and livestock herds must be a priority in the economic recovery and rebuilding of rural livelihoods in Haiti. Toward that end, Heifer International has designed and seeks to implement a 5-year project that will target 20,250 vulnerable households in strategic communities in Haiti. This project will “foster a diversified and competitive Haitian economy, leveraging the nation’s entrepreneurial spirit in inclusive and environmentally conscious ways, enabling people, communities and businesses to thrive and prosper.”

The project will assist 300 resource-poor, women-headed families in nine self help groups through training and placement of 310 camels (one camel per family and one male camel per 30 placed female camels) and 4,500 local chicken and 300 cockerels (15 chicken and one cockerel per family).  These families will each pass on one camel, 15 local chickens, one cockerel and knowledge to another 300 families belonging to other groups. The group members and their families will receive training in camel husbandry and poultry management prior to receiving their livestock. Due to high illiteracy rates, the women will undergo adult literacy classes to facilitate adoption of technology. Because the project location is in an arid and semi-arid area, environment conservation awareness training and enforcement will be an integral part of the project. The most important component of environmental training will be water harvesting and management.  After animal placement, families will receive veterinary services on a regular basis. To ensure the availability of animal health services, 24 Community Animal Workers (CAHWs) will be identified, trained and equipped to provide animal health and environmental care extension services to the community in the nine project locations including the camel umbrella expansion project area in Ngurunit, Ilaut and Arsim. They will be provided with start up capital to purchase basic veterinary equipments and drugs under a revolving fund system. PEAR Innovations and Heifer Kenya will jointly operate the revolving funds account. The money will be used in the future as a financial boost during prolonged drought conditions.
Ultimately, through participation in this project, women will be empowered to have a greater positive impact in their households and communities leading to improved livelihoods and poverty alleviation through training and food and income generation from the productive resources.Ultimately, through participation in this project, women will be empowered to have a greater positive impact in their households and communities leading to improved livelihoods and poverty alleviation through training and food and income generation from the productive resources.","","",2010-07-01,2015-06-30,"","Agriculture,Education",Livelihoods,"","","","","","Farmers, Women",Kenya>Rift Valley,Kelly Doppelhammer,East Africa Program Officer,kelly.doppelhammer@heifer.org,"",http://www.heifer.org,2012-03-27,2014-07-08,active,Private donations

The district is classified as arid and semi-arid, characterized by severe and persistent drought, massive crop failure and chronic poverty. Most areas in the district are deficient in most foodstuffs, and thus rely on relief food. Makueni is affected by widespread levels of poverty manifested in the form of food and income insecurity, severe forms of malnutrition among children, lack of access to basic social infrastructures such as health and education, and high levels of unemployment/ underemployment among the youth. The underlying causes of poverty in the district are believed to be poor agricultural production related to unreliable rainfall, lack of technical skills in sustainable agriculture and enterprise development, and lack of access to credit services. Highly fragile environment, whose degradation has been caused by poor environmental management practice and charcoal burning for income contributes to low agricultural productivity. In the past several years, the negative impacts of HIV/AIDS have added to the worsening poverty levels.","EKILUP aims at strengthening food and income generation opportunities among resource limited farm families through placement of livestock (dairy cows, goats and local chicken).  A total of 2,400 families belonging to 80 self-help groups (1,200 original families and 1,200 pass ons) will benefit from placement of various species of livestock and related services during the 5 year life of the project.  50 families will each benefit with a dairy cow, 1,200 families each with 3 local chicken and a breeding cockerel, whereas 1,150 families will each benefit from 2 galla goat does.","Heifer International Kenya has been working in the district for the last four years, implementing a meat goat and beekeeping project with resource-limited families in Kibwezi division.  Located at 210 kilometers from Heifer Kenya’s headquarters in Nairobi on the Nairobi - Mombasa highway Kibwezi division is still severely affected by persistent drought, chronic food shortage and extreme levels of poverty. Therefore, more resource-limited families from Kibwezi and other divisions of Makueni district have requested support with training and provision of various livestock species including dairy cows, dairy goats, meat goats, beehives, as well as support in milk and honey marketing.  The project will provide intensive training in integrated dairy cows, meat and dairy goats farming and poultry rearing. The project will also integrate organic farming with each of the 2,400 families, and also develop the capacity of fast learners to turn them in to peer farmer trainers. These will help the project team in extending farmer training services to the participants. Training in Heifer Cornerstones for just and sustainable development, gender and HIV/AIDS prevention and control, and family nutrition will be provided.

This technology protects maize from stem borer attack and parasitic striga weeds whilst improving soil fertility and providing livestock fodder. However, the trap and inter-crops used in current push-pull strategies are rainfall and temperature limited as the system was developed under average rainfall (800-1200mm) and moderate temperatures (15 to 30C°).

The action will identify, test and select new drought tolerant trap and inter-crops that can be incorporated into the push-pull system to enable its expansion into drier areas and develop capacity and promote wide-scale uptake.

Target areas will be Nyanza and Western Kenya provinces that are on the limit of the current push-pull system because they are more arid (< 500mm rainfall p.a.) than the locations where push-pull is used now.","Heifer International Kenya (HPI/K) will provide training in crop-livestock integration, including capacity building of participating farmer groups on exploitation of the fodder component of the push-pull technology. This will be done through the mobilization of farmer groups who have signed agreements with Heifer Kenya in Nyanza and Western regions.

The deployment and adoption of a drought-adapted push-pull strategy will deepen the services and widen the impact of HPI/K intervention on the livelihoods of the families and groups supported. This will lead to social, economic and environmental impacts at household, community and regional levels in the areas of plant health (addressing biotic and abiotic constraints), human health (improved food and nutritional security, particularly women and children), animal health (provision of quality fodder) and environmental health (sustainable natural resource use).

The project empowers people with little education (systematic education – planned in the project) and small material inputs to restore/create their professional skills and reintegrate to social community and local job market. Integration in job market is planned in such ways:
- Self-employment (registering as small-scale farmers and receiving income from selling production in market).
- Employment in Agriculture/Crafts sphere in village businesses (Cooperatives, Agriculture companies).","Sheep meat and poultry from small scale farmers are very marketable. Consumers from cities are interested in such production and even come themselves to villages to buy it there. The price of such production is by 1/5 bigger than in regular food stores. There is a lack of sheep meet in Lithuanian market (LRT Panorama research, 2011).

In this area 88% of the population is rural and the main economic activity is the production of basic grains (corn beans) coffee and some dual-purpose livestock. Most families rely primarily on seasonal agricultural work complemented by off-farm labor particularly during the lean season from February to April. These productive systems are exposed to natural disasters such as drought hurricanes flooding landslides and earthquakes that seriously affect agricultural production and food security. Climate change has exacerbated the frequency and intensity of these climate shocks with harvest losses due to natural disasters and irregular rainfall patterns predicted to worsen[1]. The Nicaraguan Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAGFOR) has identified the loss of 386 400 hectares of basic grains (corn beans rice sorghum) in the period 2005-2010 due to climate change. [2] The UNDP's Nicaragua climate change profile states that the country's annual temperature has increased by 0.9°C since 1960[3] and CIAT predicts a 2.2°C increase in temperature and an average drop in rainfall of 7.4 percent by 2050.[4] In addition to poverty in terms of resources due to the small size of their farms and depletion of their soil they lack access to agricultural and business development services such as technology credit and the inputs to incorporate new technologies (whether due to economic resources or lack of availability of inputs on the local market). They are also paid low prices for their produce and lack management capacities information and organization to take better advantage of their relationships with the market.

It will be located in two areas identified as key territories in Central America: El Trifinio and Northern Nicaragua--known as the buffer zone of the Bosawas Reserve . Most of the population in these territories live in hillsides in a state of food insecurity and vulnerability with insufficient food production to meet their basic needs; suffering from generalized extreme poverty which is reflected by the population's low human development indicators. There are limited opportunities for generating and diversifying income as well as limited access to new sources of employment.

Heifer International,HEFI-NI-13-4785,23-5003-17,foodsecurity_site,GANASOL 3,"Among the problems presented by small scale farmers who inhabit the hillsides of northern Nicaragua are low productive and reproductive indices of family livestock. Among the main causes are the practice of overgrazing, mishandling paddocks (burning and deforestation), drought, poor animal health management and  little transfer of livestock technologies. Consequently small scale producers have low productivity of milk cattle, underweight and slow herd reproduction, which impacts the availability of food resources and low capacity of family income. 
During the dry season pastures are reduced and lowers the  quality of animals thus dramatically lowers production this makes a lot of producers sell part of their livestock, or worse, cattle die from lack of fodder. Similarly livestock in the winter are in a state of malnutrition which hinders their body weight and production levels to recover. All this becomes a recurring cycle every year causing loss of income and food insecurity. 
The project GANASOL 3 is part of the program and contribute to improving the livelihoods of families living on the slopes of northern Nicaragua. We will work to improve household livestock that was bought and distributed for families and conditions will be improved in the existing family livestock. We will contribute training of agroecological practices for farms that allow families to cope with the effects of climate change. We will also contribute in improving livestock health for increased milk production. Technical assistance and training inputs to adopt and disseminate best practices and learning techniques of soil conservation and water will be provided. The project will last for 3 years.

These families are from the province of Anta in the Cusco region, are members of the association and sell their agricultural products directly in the Cusco market. Most of these families are either poor or extremely poor, which is apparent in the serious malnutrition among their children, high rates of illiteracy, lack of basic services, poor organic production systems and little connection to local markets.  This project will contribute to improving food systems and living conditions for 1,540 families (320 original families and 1,220 through Heifer’s Pass on the Gift process), beginning with the planned management of their resources, implementation of agroecology, linking them to local markets and involving them in processes that impact local and regional policies for rural families. Sound agroecologyical practices, the preservation of Andean biodiversity and the strengthening of rural community orgnizations will be fostered through the project.

The Lambayeque and Cajamarca regions are located in northern Peru. Poverty rates in these regions are 40.6 percent and 56 percent, respectively. Both regions have several ecological levels that allow the cultivation of a variety of products in different seasons. Although the details differ, both regions have a high degree of mining activity, which has not resulted in better living conditions for families. Instead, much of the population still has unsatisfied basic needs. There is a need for profound economic and social transformation to address poverty and environmental degradation.

Heifer International,HEFI-PE-11-3817,23-1743-02,foodsecurity_site,Food Security Enhancement and Entrepreneurial Development (FEED) Project,"Through the Food Security Enhancement and Entrepreneurial Development (FEED) Project, Heifer aims to increase the income and food security of 700 Peruvian women and their families—320 original participants and 380 through Heifer’s Pass on the Gift (POG) process. FEED will work with eight associations in the Puno region of Peru to support women’s economic activities and promote a greater role for women in family and community decision-making.
Puno is one of the poorest departments in Peru. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Information , 41.6 percent of the population of Puno faces extreme poverty, defined as the inability to purchase essential food items. Diets in the communities targeted by this project are nutritionally poor, with food intake limited to noodles, sugar, vegetable oil, drinks and crackers, resulting in severe nutritional deficiencies. According to the United Nations’ Children’s Fund, 30 percent of Puno’s children ages 0 to 5 face chronic malnutrition.
Currently, women in the area lack the training and access to key inputs for improved agricultural and livestock production that would strengthen their capacities as “bread makers” and position them to be “bread winners,” thus empowering them to take on a greater role in family decision-making. In particular, women need to know how to recognize early warning signs of agricultural issues and practice risk-reducing techniques to minimize their families’ vulnerability to the annual onset of extreme weather, drought and frost that often result in losses in crops, grains and animals. Women in the target project area are primarily rural Quechua and Aymara—groups that are highly vulnerable to poverty due to the ethnic and gender discrimination they face, causing them to have less access to education than their male counterparts, less legal and political representation, less access to professional training and fewer income-earning opportunities. As these women’s labor is mostly unpaid, it is undervalued in Peru’s patriarchal society, leading women to have little say in household decision-making, particularly regarding household finances.
FEED is a continuation of an existing Heifer project, Departmental Association of Campesina Women of Puno (ADEMUCP) for Food Security in Puno, which has provided initial technical assistance to women’s productive associations in Puno since July 1, 2008. Through this project, Heifer has increased women’s technical capacities in agriculture and animal husbandry to help them increase and diversify their income and improve family food security and nutrition. FEED will build upon the previous project’s success in increasing productivity levels by strengthening the institutional and marketing capacities of eight key associations. These associations will help the women achieve higher production volumes attractive to buyers, lower production costs and allow the women to collectively market their products, thereby integrating the women into agriculturally based value chains. FEED will also increase rural revenues by supporting crafts production—a non-farm economic activity with strong marketing potential in the highly touristic project area.
During a project period of three years, Heifer will lead the development and implementation of activities to meet the following three principle objectives by June 30, 2014:
• At least 70 percent of women in eight associations will have increased their income by 20 percent through the production and marketing of local agricultural products and handicrafts.
• At least 80 percent of women in eight associations will have improved their nutrition and that of their families through the consumption of highly nutritious, locally produced food.
• At least 70 percent of women in eight associations will have increased their participation in family decision-making, particularly in relation to household income expenditures.
The beneficiaries of the project will be 700 women organized in eight producer groups belonging to ADEMUCP, which is part of the Farm Confederation of Peru. Heifer Peru has worked with women organized in ADEMUCP in other projects since 2003. Founded in 1947, ADEMUCP includes more than nine provincial associations of women farmers.

Through the Heifer’s Pass on the Gift process and Values-based holistic community approach, the project will benefit 120 original families and 480 pass on families. Macabari is a coastal village along the Pacific Ocean, and fishing and farming are the primary livelihoods. Like most other rural, coastal communities in the Philippines, most of its families are socio-politically and economically disadvantaged. This situation is aggravated by the deteriorating state of the environment in the area. The mangrove forest are diminishing, illegal fishing are rampant, and disposal of wastes in the coast are common problems. In the adjoining upland area, the watershed and forest are deteriorating, there is no systematic solid waste management and people generally lack awareness on environmental management. Poor housing, health and sanitation and inadequate potable water are major issues faced by families.  Typhoons and storm surges frequently devastate fishing boats, farms and homes, further aggravating the already poor conditions. Farming productivity is low here because of poor farming practices and  that affects farming seasons.This project will improve awareness of the participants on natural resource management, facilitate passage of environmental local laws in the village, improve fish sanctuary through mangrove reforestation and cleaning of the coastal area.  Families in the upland vicinity will establish  agro-forestry and organic farms and improve solid waste management systems. NRM monitoring committees will be established in the villages. Heifer will also provide 58 families each with one heifer and five chickens, 10 families each with one carabao heifer and five chickens, 18 families each with one non-motorized boat and fishing net, 16 families each with one pig and five chickens, 14 families each with one pig and one fishing net, and four families each with one pig and one fishing net.

Small farmers will receive Irish Friesian heifers. In addition to passing on the first female offspring, the farmers will also donate milk to orphan children. The project will serve children from orphanages located in the Central and Western part of Romania. Through Pass On Gift, every year more farmers will receive a dairy Friesian heifer. Coordinating the delivery of dairy products, Heifer Romania will bridge the two target groups. The project expects to feed more than 5,000 children.

A total of 140 Friesian cows will be airlifted by Bothar Ireland, 70 cows per year, during a two-year period. Through the project, high quality livestock and training will be provided to farmers in order to improve their nutrition, increase their income and improve local livestock.

The targeted communities are located in the hilly region near Cluj. About 60 percent of the families do not have consistent income. They are trying to establish small-scale private farming in order to earn their living. They are all accustomed to growing both grains and animals. The farms are small and livestock are mixed-breed. Some families have a horse used for transportation and for working the farmland. Similar to many other Romanian farms, cows are grazed on community pastures. The Irish Friesian breed is appropriate for the Transylvanian plateau because the cows have a dual purpose - milk and beef. By raising this type of cattle the pastures will be efficiently maintained with grazing being semi-intensive. The farmers are very interested in purebred cows and have committed to modernize their farm management and practices.

One hundred heifers will be distributed to small farmers in the hilly region near Cluj, Transylvania. The families that receive a heifer will Pass On the Gift (POG) of the first female offspring to another impoverished family along with 79 gallons of milk to the orphaned children. Each year more than 1,000 children will benefit from farmers’ milk donations.

Through this project, urban orphanages will receive milk and other fresh dairy products, collected and processed by the Animal Breeders Association in Corus, one of Heifer Romania’s most reliable project partners.

The extra income will allow families to purchase and consume more meat and vegetables, balancing their nutrition. All families involved have basic knowledge of milk processing. Women will be self-employed as they are traditionally considered to be in charge of milking and making the dairy products. The women will have a secure job in their own household bringing a contribution to the family’s income and stability (an important element in a country that has had to deal with the negative consequences of emigration, which has had a significant impact on women who are often left behind to support large families).","Widows, physically challenged, unemployed women, mothers with many children or single mothers will have priority for the distribution of heifers. Also wives, together with their husbands, will sign the contract for receiving the gift of livestock and will be encouraged to take decisions jointly. Through the Cornerstones training, a special emphasis will be given to gender equity and full participation. Women will be encouraged to attend the meetings and become actively involved in the life of the project. 

The basis of this initiative is the dairy cow, which will provide women with an occupation. Attending specialized training sessions, they will acquire know-how and competence. Their professional development and self-esteem will be strengthened, gaining respect and position within the community.

The lives of women will be easier as each participant family will receive milking equipment. The families will not have to work the land by hand anymore, as the group of producers will be equipped with the necessary agricultural machines to produce nutritious fodder for the animals.

The targeted families of this project are low income smallholder farmers, upland farm families, charcoal burners, wood cutters and hunters in predominantly savanna ecologies. The project will provide 24,000 cashew seedlings and 24,000 pre-germinated cashew seeds to 400 farm families in 20 groups at 60 seedlings (1 acre) per family. The International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) is providing gifts in kind in the form of 12,800 bundles of cassava cuttings to be distributed at 32 bundles per family to project families.  Cultivation of cassava which serves as both food and cash crop is very common in the district as it serves as a means of providing quick income for families while awaiting the maturation of the cashew nuts. For this reason, the project seeks to establish two cassava processing schemes in two of the five participating chiefdoms.  Cashew starts fruiting in three years and provides a long lasting source of income. Both crops (cassava and cashew) thrive well in the district and will generate higher yields with good management practices such as the application of manure.  As goats are the preferred livestock for the families, the project will place 1,600 goats at 4 per family (1 male and 3 female). Training in crops production and livestock husbandry practices, drugs and veterinary support services, sound agro forestry practices will also be provided. A large number of households in Port Loko district rely solely on farming for their livelihoods. But increasing environmental degradation over the years has been undermining the utilization of the full potential of arable land. These environmental threats impact heavily on rural livelihoods, food security and health, while exacerbating natural disasters such as floods and droughts. Integrating environmental concerns into livelihood enhancement initiatives is therefore a priority for any development intervention in Port Loko district. In addition to the integration of cashew trees and cassava cuttings, ILAF will seek to establish 10 hectares of fast growing trees in the communities where the cassava processing schemes will be operating. These trees will be harvested to provide fuel wood for the running of the processing equipment.In addition to the 400 original farm families, 1,400 additional families will benefit from pass ons over the five year period.

Also the entire project communities will benefit from environmental conservation and have unrestricted access to clean and safe drinking water through the construction of ten wells in the project communities. 
All original families of the project will receive training in improved livestock husbandry/crop and livestock integration. Veterinary drugs, equipment and community-based veterinary support services will be provided for each group. The project will also work towards greater understanding of rights and obligation issues.  Issues especially relating to conflict between crop farmers and livestock owners, principal protection issues (including gender-based violence); and the capacity to address these through community actions, while linking up with government authorities and other relevant stakeholders in the district. The project will organize community tree planting programs and conduct monthly education and sensitization sessions on sound soil conservation and environmental practices in all target communities. Advocacy forum to be created will include chiefs, councilors, members of parliament, crop farmers and livestock owners particularly cattle owners and other relevant stakeholders.  The goal will be to address destructive conservation practices such as indiscriminate burning; uncontrolled grazing as a result of free range livestock rearing that is responsible for the increased conflict between crop farmers and livestock owners.

The project will be implemented by the ASC, an emerging private membership-based collective ownership enterprise, which manages the profits of its members. This is the first attempt for poor rural households to unite not only for milk collection and marketing, but also for processing raw milk into value-added products by the ASC. Project participants will establish a “production-processing-marketing food chain”, which meets all requirements of the World Trade Organization. By doing so, they will also create competitive conditions for rural households due to an increase in the purchasing price for raw milk, thereby stimulating the development of small and medium dairy farms. The 126 participating rural households—63 original families and another 63 who will benefit from Passing on the Gift—are expected to see profits improve by 25 percent due to the increased purchasing prices when milk processing starts. Additionally, due to an expected subsequent 15 percent decrease in the price of milk, this project will create opportunities to improve the nutrition of children, people with disabilities, retirees and orphans, who will enjoy sufficient amounts of high-quality dairy products.","To resolve the issue of purchasing a milk processing unit to process raw milk locally, the cooperative has approached the State Administration of Kirovohrad oblast with a request for funding to purchase the “Kolax K 1.3000.24” modular dairy processing unit. After learning the results of the “Ivankovetskyi Svitanok” activities and studying the cooperative’s business plan, the State Administration has agreed to provide co-financing in the amount of $50,000 to support the purchase of the “Kolax” modular dairy processing unit, in addition to the $60,000 requested from Heifer. 

Purchasing and setting the “Kolax” modular dairy processing equipment into operation will be a considerable support for the future development of the “Ivankovetskyi Svitanok” ASC and, consequently, will increase the incomes of its members by implementing the complete dairy food chain “from production to processing to marketing”. The “Kolax” dairy processing module (certified ISO 9001) will enable the cooperative to collect, process, and pack 3,000 kg of milk per shift and receive natural and environmentally friendly dairy products: pasteurized whole milk, normalized pasteurized whole milk, pasteurized creams, and sour cream.

The main problems faced by rural farmers are marketing their crop yield and their limited knowledge about or lack of funds regarding modern farming technologies. The Strawberries Communities development project “Ecofruit” hopes to tackle these issues and take advantage of the opportunities for this type of farming, such as the favorable climate and soil conditions and the high demand for strawberries both on the fresh market and in processing. Currently, Ukraine produces 25-30 percent less than what the country consumes, with the rest imported. There are many challenges currently facing strawberry farmers in Ukraine. Some examples are, the current production practices are outdated, no irrigation system, growing the wrong varieties for the climate zone, fungal diseases, lack of skilled workers, low quality, unstable crops, and no strategy for future development. Once smallholders learn how to optimize the cultivation of the berries and find stable channels for selling, they can increase their strawberry production and, therefore, increase incomes. This project will help organize a cooperative to share equipment, access to technologies, and to organize joint selling of berries in bulk quantities.","","",2012-03-01,2016-06-30,"",Agriculture,"","","","","","","",Ukraine>Ternopil',Babsi Snowden,Program Associate,Babsi.Snowden@heifer.org,"",http://www.heifer.org,2014-05-08,2014-07-08,active,""

For this reason, Heifer Vietnam has been focusing its resources to improve the livelihood and support the farmers to gain their self-reliance for many years.

This project is the joint effort of Heifer Vietnam and four provinces of the Mekong Delta -  Tra Vinh, Vinh Long, Kien Giang and Soc Trang - to continuously assist small-holder farmers to improve their livelihoods as well as create critical impact in those provinces. In addition, to achieve large scale critical impact, the local authorities will mobilize resources from local community members, government programs and financial institutions (government banks, micro-credit institutions…) to assist the targeted communities.

Small-holder farmers are targeted in this project. Those interested in passing on the gifts and committed to take initiative in improving their livelihood and communities will be selected. Priority will be given to households led by women and those socially deprived and climate change affected. The project areas are the poorest communities in the four provinces.","The project aims to improve livelihoods of the target communities by building social capital and igniting the transformation process.

The goal of CRLESP is to enable vulnerable rural farm families in the region to enhance and secure their livelihoods through integrated agriculture, promotion of health and enterprise development. Specifically, the project will address poor household food security caused by low agricultural productivity; poor nutrition, especially in children; limited ability of resource-poor families to own livestock; limited capacity of local agricultural and veterinary extensions to engage in outreach; poor health, hygiene and sanitation practices; inadequate capacity of official health and social services to engage in outreach; high levels of deforestation; and poor marketing structures. The high incidence of HIV/AIDS in these communities has also resulted in many households becoming more food insecure at a time when people require good nutrition, particularly high-quality protein.CRLESP will directly benefit a total of 37,260 individuals within 6,210 direct project households (average of six people per family). From this total, 680 families will be assisted through the placement of food- and income-generating livestock and training in integrated livestock management. Further, 5,530 families will benefit from other community interventions such as environmental and HIV/AIDS mitigation and better hygiene and sanitation awareness. Trainings will include Heifer’s 12 Cornerstones, animal husbandry and health, gender equity issues and group organizational capacity. The project will implement integrated agriculture practices and vegetable gardens to improve nutrition among vulnerable groups such as children and people living with HIV/AIDS. Improved delivery of community-based animal health services will improve livestock health and productivity, thus safeguarding livelihoods. Linkages to viable markets and technical service providers will provide opportunities for the development of sustainable farming enterprises for the project members. Widespread use of energy efficient wood stoves in combination with agroecological farming practices will reduce deforestation in target areas. Further, the trainings and awareness-raising programs will significantly increase knowledge in HIV/AIDS mitigation and better health, hygiene and sanitation in all targeted communities.

Heifer International,HEFI-ZM-13-4239,21-0158-01,foodsecurity_site,Enhanced Smallholder Livestock Enterprise and Market Project,"The economic environment of the rural poor comprises several interlocking markets: for agricultural produce, for agricultural inputs, for production support in terms of extension services, for financial services, for information, for assets and other consumer goods. The terms upon which the rural poor enter and participate in such markets is sometimes inequitable. Many of the poor are currently passive participants, often obliged to sell low and buy high with little choice of where they conduct transactions, with whom and what price. With the liberalization of the domestic markets, these markets have become more open, with more choices but also complex and uncertain. Liberalization of domestic and international markets gives the poor new opportunities to participate. Today more than ever before, enhancing the ability of the rural poor to reach these markets, actively engage in them is one of the most pressing development challenges.
The problem of market access may be considered in three dimensions: the physical (distance to the market), the political (inability to influence the terms of participation in the markets) and structural (lack of market intermediaries)
In the dairy sector, about 81% to 83% of the milk produced by smallholder farmers is sold through the informal market with a very short value chain. The milk is either produced and consumed at household level or sold to consumers in the community at the farm gate prices (Strategic Visions Ltd 2011). In such markets there are few bulk purchases as opposed to small quantity purchases and as such do not stimulate commercialization.
Goat meat has become the second largest source of red meat after cattle in the towns and cities of Zambia. However, the marketing chain is still very informal meaning there are no established traders who buy goats and there are also no butcheries that specifically slaughter goats. The goats are sold by individual farmers in nearby cities or local communities thus getting low prices for them or not selling many goats at once.",The project directly links to the objective of improving agricultural productivity through innovative approaches to and reintegration into the productive sector. It does this by supporting the increased resilience of households by helping them sustainably increase agricultural yields. Linked to this is the introduction of high quality breeds of dairy cattle and goat production. Dairy production has a high earning potential that has proven (where it has been introduced) to completely transform households from living hand to mouth to being able to grow and expand their productive activities. Goats as well provide a tangible asset that grows from year to year with little family labor needed.,"",2013-04-01,2016-06-30,Food Security and Agriculture,Agriculture,"","","","",Heifer Zambia,"","",Zambia>Copperbelt,Lisa Dixon,Program Officer,lisa.dixon@heifer.org,"",http://www.heifer.org,2013-08-01,2014-07-10,active,Private donations

However, due to the continued poverty in the community and the difficult socioeconomic circumstances in the entire country in the last couple of years, there were a number of hurdles in implementing the project, resulting in limited achievement of the project’s objectives. Funds for livestock purchases were eroded by the hyper-inflationary environment that prevailed in Zimbabwe in the last decade, thus Heifer was unable to place all of the livestock as planned.Phase II of the Hope for the San People Project will target 200 original and 400 Pass on the Gift (POG) families, which will be organized in groups of 20 people.

Difficulties included accessing effective and appropriate health services, information and support; a lack of knowledge and understanding among communities about prevention and care; discrimination and stigma; poor disease detection and a poor response in national health policies.

The aim of the project is to increase awareness among 3,000 family members and carers, and 50,000 community members (including 25,000 older people) about the causes, care and impact of mental health illnesses. It also aims to improve access to appropriate mental health services for 18,000 older people (9,900 women), 1,500 of who have dementia or other mental illnesses; 
and to establish community based care models in 10 communities to support patients of dementia and their carers.","Capacity Building of Carers and Health Professionals:

The project will directly train 3,000 family members and carers (70% women) in how to prevent/delay mental illness; understand and cope with care responsibilities and have access to the support they need. 500 primary health care professionals from the target areas will be trained to diagnose, treat and provide support to patients and their carers. Local PHC services are under the supervision of higher levels of health authorities; training cannot be provided without the knowledge and consent of the health authorities, it is expected that departmental and provincial public health authorities, will not only be aware of the training but will be directly involved to promote the future replication. The trained primary health staff will screen 18,000 older people from the community and they will support the 1,500 people who are likely to be identified with dementia or other severe mental illness. Trained local carers form the basis of our community-based care model.

Community Awareness Raising:

Advocacy and awareness-raising workshops and campaigns will take place at the local level with 50,000 community members (including 25,000 older people), service providers, decision makers and local authorities to bring about changes in attitude and break down stigma associated with mental illness. Sensitization of local authorities and community members will encourage project learning and best practices are integrated into local planning and local sociology-sanitary budgets in 10 communities to enable them to implement community/municipal projects such as a counseling office, a day care center and other mental health support.

Advocacy:

At the national level in the 3 countries, meetings and workshops with health authorities and key actors will integrate the learning and best practice from the project into mental health policy and programs. ","Older people are disproportionately affected by mental disorders which reduce their productivity and capacity for independent living. Their dependency on others for care, and their inability to contribute to household income places substantial psychological strain and insupportable financial burdens on family and community members already living in poverty. Universal pension schemes, disability living allowances, and caregiver benefits are limited. A high proportion of caregivers have to cut back on their paid work to provide care, bring in extra support from other family members and fund expensive medical costs. Abandonment of older people can result when families are unable to carry this burden. Rural older people, minority native older people and poor urban people are particularly affected by the lack of adequate health care provision as a result of their distance from health centers, discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or because of financial constraints.

HelpAge USA,HELP-BO-14-5648,COL000,"",Measuring Healthy Aging ,"Defining healthy aging has significant challenges. Standard medical or health outcomes, predicated on measuring improvements in health, are not completely useful within the ageing context. It is likely that the average health status of a cohort of 80 year olds, will be somewhat poorer than an equivalent cohort of 60 year olds. WHO data and research studies from around the world, for example Sweden, confirm that health status as a whole declines with age, despite the best possible medical interventions. By the age of 77, the majority of Swedes will already have two or more chronic illnesses, and this is in spite of the fact that Sweden is the highest ranked country on the Global AgeWatch Index. In two letters to the BMJ in 2005, Ong and Forbes laid out a concept that at the end of life, medicalising this period of life within a procedures driven or targets oriented health system, could result in physical symptoms and their management becoming prioritized, with little consideration given to the balance between medical treatments, length of life and quality of life. They also articulated the idea that certain forms of socially oriented care may come to dominate the overall care package (which must of course, include health care) when at certain stages in late life or at the end of life, quality of life is given priority over mere survival.  Many of these issues are pertinent to the way in which we might successfully measure healthy aging. Health status improvements are perhaps, appropriate markers of an effective health outcome for those who have just entered older age, but gradually, within the aging process, a progressively delicate balance has to be struck between medicalising care (when appropriate) and therefore, extending life; maintaining or improving quality of life, and then finally, managing symptoms and disabilities. ","Within the context of this project, we are also aiming to produce a rapid, easy to use, short-form instrument, that will be suitable for evaluating programs/interventions in low and middle income contexts. 

We will attempt to find a balance between brevity of instrument and a design that will still enable epidemiological data collection and case tracking capabilities. This is a significant challenge, but is much needed by the development and aging community, because rapid assessments, beneficiaries targeting and evaluations of outcomes, often have to be conducted concurrently in remote and isolated communities. 

Partners, country office and rural health center staff have suggested that the interview process should not take up more than 15-20 minutes per person if possible, because of their heavy patient/beneficiary work load.
 
","Latin America was chosen as the test site for this project because of HelpAge’s long history of work in the region. Two countries will be involved in this project, Bolivia and Colombia. These countries have, within a development context, relatively well developed health systems, and as such, are useful markers for the state of health services development within a middle income setting. Additionally, it affords us the possibility of exploring outcomes for older people thorough the lens of a wide variety of interventions, including but not necessarily restricted to health programs alone.

The proposed program would work through mobilized Older People’s Associations to strengthen four basic elements of health and care: social interaction, awareness of self-care, regular medical examinations, and care within the community. The project will work to build and expand four OPAs and local community health stations in Chengdu City and will reach approximately 2,100 older people. Each area of intervention will be explored through research and the results of each step will be professionally monitored, documented and then widely publicized.
HelpAge will work in partnership with Sichuan University because of the technical skills of its School of Public Health and its collaboration with HelpAge since the 1990s on a number of age-related projects. The School of Public Health will implement the project under the technical leadership, monitoring, and guidance of HelpAge International.","China: Mobilizing four Older People’s Associations. HelpAge will identify and train leaders in the urban and peri-urban communities who would be best suited to organize and mobilize OPAs. The mobilization of OPAs will reduce social isolation and provide the ability to develop plans that meet local needs. Furthermore, they will build a strong channel for government health and care services to reach the most vulnerable older people. The OPAs will be self-managed and sustainable organizations with the ability to provide ongoing services to meet the needs of older people in their communities beyond the project duration.

Korea: HelpAge proposes to develop and support two Older People’s Self-Help Groups. Responding both to the need and demand of disadvantaged older people for group formation, our long-term plan is to increase the number of OPSHGs in the country. The objective of the plan is to establish a national platform for disadvantaged older people. The purpose will not only be to strengthen active participation in the OPSHG’s, but to make contributions to community development and form a unified voice in advocating for older people’s rights to basic income security and health and care services. HelpAge Korea’s management goal in supporting OPSHGs is to build their capacity to be fully sustainable and both self-financing and self-governing. It is expected that the self-governance of OPSHGs in the community can be achieved through support over a period of two years, with two distinct phases: 1) an 18 month phase focused on the establishment, capacity building, and development of activities including home visit programs and fund-raising, and 2) a 6 month phase, beyond the project period, of ongoing mentoring support from HelpAge Korea.
","China: 

The breakdown of extended family support structures in rural and some urban areas as a result of the migration trend places a tremendous burden on older people in terms of care for themselves and their grandchildren. Better care services and support mechanisms for these communities must be put into place in order to address the needs of these older people and their families. Due to the large exponential growth in the older population, Western-style institutional care alone would not have the capacity to resolve many of the challenges in poor communities. In line with China’s care policy, HelpAge concludes that there needs to be a balance between both institutional care options and approaches to care within the home and community for older people. Community Older People’s Associations (OPAs) are a highly effective approach to help older people engage more actively in supporting their needs and those of their communities. OPAs utilize the unique resources and skills older people have to provide effective social support and to facilitate activities and deliver services. 

Korea: 

Korea is an aging society with rapid growth of the older population. The estimated population over 65 today is 5.5 million or 10%, rising to 14% by 2018 and over 20% in 2026. Korea's average life span has shown the fastest growth among OECD countries due to growing public interest in health and improved health services. Korea's life span rose by 25 years between 1960 and 2007, and average life expectancy for Koreans born in 2007 was 79.4 years.

As the population grows older, government budgets for welfare, healthcare and social pensions for older people have all increased. However, these still fall short of securing the lives of many older Koreans, both physically and financially, and insecurity of life in old age for the poor remains a serious problem.

HelpAge USA,HELP-CO-14-5650,COL001,"finance,older people","Financial Inclusion and Aging – Facts, Challenges and Actions Needed","The project’s span of concern will be aging and financial services in middle and low income countries, particularly in Latin America, where older persons as a percentage of the total population is rising steeply. Lessons from high income countries may be drawn in, but are not the focus.

The investigation (and resulting issue paper) will begin with a brief recapitulation of demographic and financial inclusion data to lay out the case for attention to financial services in the context of an aging population. 

It will proceed to explore income strategies in older age through direct engagement with mature adults and older people to understand their needs and motivations and drawing on research HelpAge has already done.  HelpAge’s prior work has revealed that there is much more variation in income strategies than stereotypical images suggest. We will investigate these patterns further through client-based research in Colombia. 

This work will not be confined strictly to looking at older age. Understanding intergenerational dynamics of household finances is critical for gaining insights on the needs for financial services in later life. Youth unemployment, for example, places a financial burden on the older generation when adult children continue to rely on their parents for housing and subsistence. Large scale migration, as well as HIV/AIDS epidemic, create large numbers of skipped-generation households where children are in care of their grandparents. The emotional and financial cost of this care arrangement is high but unrecognized.

The resulting picture of the varieties of later life income strategies will provide the foundation for moving on to specific financial services needs and issues, such as the following:

Income security
•Income security in older age is not only relevant in old age. Preparation for older age requires advanced planning that is necessary at all stages of the life course.","HelpAge and CFI will collaborate in producing an issue paper, drawing together existing research each organization has done and consulting with experts in aging or financial inclusion. Two non-probabilistic surveys will be implemented: one online questionnaire exploring the global supply side of financial inclusion and the other using in-person interviews to examine the needs and barriers of older adults to a range of financial services and their access to income in Colombia. The paper will frame the main concerns and will offer preliminary recommendations for action and further research. 

Two in-person roundtables will be held, one in Colombia in workshop-style format that tests the initial findings of the issue paper and one in New York to disseminate the results to hand-selected stakeholders and identify action opportunities.  To ensure that the priority actors are present, each roundtable will have 35-45 invitation-only participants. Recommendations will be finalized on the basis of the first roundtable and integrated into the final publication. 
","The broad problem this project addresses is the exclusion of older people from adequate financial services in middle and lower income countries, particularly in Latin America. The specific purpose of this project is to develop knowledge on financial services needs in older age and carry that knowledge into a dialogue with actors that are driving financial inclusion, so that they can respond to those needs more effectively. 

Demographic analysis, as laid out in CFI’s paper, Looking through the Demographic Window and HelpAge International’s Global AgeWatch Index Insight Report, reveals the rapid aging of the population in low and middle income countries. In many countries, over-65 is the fastest growing population age bracket. Life expectancy is rising in almost every country in the world, so most people will need to face the unique financial needs and responsibilities that accompany later life. This issue is especially salient for older women who often have less access to employment, savings and financial services across the life course, and tend to live longer than men in nearly all societies. 

At a societal level, this unprecedented shift will require revision in how we organize societies to ensure that the needs of older people are met, and financial services is an important arena in which adjustments are needed.

Aging raises some very specific challenges for financial inclusion. When it comes to financial services, older adults are a distinct client segment whose characteristics have not been fully explored. Financial services could play an important facilitating role in meeting several of the most pressing needs related to aging, such as adequate income security and access to health care. To date, very few resources have been allocated toward understanding financial needs across the life course, particularly in older age. Given the speed of demographic change, research and action on this issue is critical to the goal of financial inclusion for all.

Each cistern has the capacity to hold 2,000-liters. Water collected from the 100 houses will also be shared with a further 100 neighboring households to cover their weekly needs during the rainy seasons (April/May and Aug-Nov).

To encourage behavioral changes in personal and environmental hygiene the project manager, a public health specialist, will carry out 100 public health and sanitation information sessions in community halls. These will cover issues such as water treatment techniques, the role of hygiene in disease prevention and the importance protecting water sources from contamination; each session will reach 50-100 community members. The Project manager will also train 12 school staff, 2 health clinic staff and 2 community agents, volunteers recruited from the community, to be trainers themselves in hygiene, environmental sanitation and water treatment. On these issues the school teachers will go on to train 600 students during classes and the health clinic staff will educate 20-30 patients that visit them daily. Water-purifying pumps will also be provided in-kind by DFID and distributed to 600 households. These pumps purify water from any source, even dirty water from ponds or rivers will come out clean and safe for drinking. DFID has recommended HelpAge to test pump usage among beneficiaries in Haiti. ","In March 2013, HelpAge conducted a survey of 100 households in Fond Jean Noel. For the six localities targeted by this project, 82.5% do not have access to piped drinking water and 75% do not have a rainwater capture and storing system. Water collection can take a minimum of two hours over difficult mountain paths making water collection too arduous for older, handicapped or sick people; the burden of fetching water relies on a few young adults, mostly on children. The 100 targeted households have been identified by the community as being the most vulnerable because they are headed by an older person (55 years and over) who take care of grandchildren or households with a disabled person living there. 

Students and the health clinic patients have no on-site access to water because the old rainwater harvesting and storage systems are destroyed. Children and sick people already have increased susceptibility to infection making them highly vulnerable to diseases and death through contaminated water, poor hygiene and sanitation. Some of the most prevalent health issues raised by the population are Typhoid and diarrhea; two waterborne related diseases, however, understanding among the community about disease prevention through water treatment, sanitation and hygiene is low.

It will also employ an inter-generational approach to capacity strengthening where children trained will pass on information to other members of their households, particularly older persons with low literacy levels. ","The training of community emergency response teams has proven to be a very effective tool in disaster risk reduction and reducing vulnerabilities in communities, since people in the community are the first responders and external assistance is quite often slow to arrive. Approximately 100 people from 5 communities in Portland, St Thomas and St Mary will receive training in a number of disaster management areas. This training includes Basic Disaster Preparedness, First Aid, Light Search and Rescue, Psychological and social First Aid, Initial Damage and Needs Assessment, Emergency Care and Fire Safety.

The loss of livelihoods after severe flooding and hurricanes is a regular occurrence in disaster affected rural communities in Jamaica. Many times farmers are not able to fully recover from the losses they incur and some, particularly the older farmers who have no other form of livelihood to fall back on, sink deeper into poverty. The Farmer Field School methodology will be employed in the training of farmers as another strategy to help protect their livelihoods. 

A disaster fund was set up under the recently concluded USAID/OFDA funded project, implemented by HelpAge International. The micro insurance scheme was set up to act as an informal risk transfer mechanism for farmers impacted by natural disasters. The scheme is managed at the community level by executives of the farmers groups. Together executives and farmers alike create rules and regulations that govern membership, premium amounts and payment schedules, rules for honoring claims, among other factors. Seven communities in St. Catherine were part of this activity and this fund is managed by a management committee drawn from the executives of all farmers groups.","HelpAge has been operational in the Caribbean since 1985 and is the leading organization working on aging issues in the region. The organization has supported the development of a number of non-governmental organizations in Jamaica and the rest of the region helping them to fight poverty and social exclusion of older people in their respective countries. 

HelpAge’s work with its partners and older people in Jamaica has emphasized capacity building in organization and management and advocacy, as well as supporting projects in health and social care, social protection, and livelihoods. Recognizing the nexus between poverty and the impact of disasters on older people, HelpAge has worked with its partners and older people for a number of years to create awareness among government agencies and the humanitarian community of the need to mainstream older people into disaster preparedness and planning. HelpAge also has a deliberate strategy treating disaster risk reduction and disaster preparedness as a cross-cutting issue in its work with partners and communities. 

The program is aimed at communities in St. Catherine, St. Mary, St. Thomas and Portland that are highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Disasters affect these populations by damaging their homes, road networks and destruction of their livelihood assets. The most vulnerable groups in the target communities are farmers, especially older women farmers; children and youth; older persons (both men and women) and people with disabilities.

During the period 1990-2006 Jamaica recorded a total of 13 disasters, affecting 943,734 persons (OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database), the largest for any English-speaking Caribbean country. The economic cost to the country totaled US$ 1.8 billion.

In 2008, HelpAge International, as part of a group of organizations, commenced implementation of Phase I of the Government of Kenya led and DFID-financed Hunger Safety Net Program (HSNP). The objective of Phase I (April 2007 - March 2012) was to design and pilot cost-effective mechanisms for beneficiary targeting, payment delivery and grievance management in four districts in Northern Kenya (Turkana, Marsabit, Mander and Wajir). The focus of this activity was to be a comparison of the cost-effectiveness of three different types of targeting methodology: a social pension (for all older people aged over a certain age threshold), community-based targeting, and targeting based on household ‘dependency ratio’. 

Phase II (2012-2017) is expected to roll out the mechanism developed in Phase I, along with the processes for payments and grievance management, to 150,000 households. Beyond 2017 it is hoped that the Government of Kenya will carry the program forward as part of an integrated national social protection strategy to include: effective integration of existing safety net programs into a coordinated national social protection system, a commitment to social transfers as measured by spending on social transfer programs as a percentage of national income, and an increase in the proportion of people receiving cash transfers relative to emergency food aid.
","The main activities will be to build the capacity of duty bearers (such as statutory bodies, the private sector or NGOs) to better realize Social Protection Rights while concurrently building the capacities of claim holders and civil society that represent them to better claim Social Protection Rights. ","In Kenya, people who are poor and marginalized and therefore in most need of state intervention to improve their livelihoods are often those who are most unlikely to receive support. This may be due to systemic problems such as requirements of user fees, distances from service institutions and the relative complexity of government operations. Most of the time however, access to government services is denied to these groupings due to their inability to participate in governance, institutionalized discrimination; and lack of transparency and accountability in government functions. They are also unable to complain about poor services due to barriers which prevent them from accessing complaints mechanisms’ such as high levels of illiteracy, poor infrastructure, nomadic lifestyle and low knowledge in government operational systems.  

Establishing a rights based framework supported by both the government and the public can provide a means for holding the government accountable for providing services. Critical to this is the direct participation of the people. Participation and non-discrimination in governance provides an important opportunity for poor and marginalized groups to contribute to the realization of their rights. This also allows governments to meaningfully implement pro-poor interventions in their budgeting and service provision.

HelpAge USA,HELP-MM-12-5192,MYA029,"capacity building,older people",Reducing Poverty in Myanmar through Older People's Initiatives,"The project aims to reduce poverty in selected rural villages and two peri-urban areas of Myanmar through mobilizing older people and building their capacities to establish, develop, manage and sustain Older People Self Help Groups (OPSHGs). Support will be given to these Groups to initiate and implement development activities within their own communities by promoting better understanding of issues facing older people, and establishing both better relationships as well as closer coordination with local authorities for the betterment of all. ","This proposed project will place special emphasis on building the capacities of Community Development Officers (CDOs), the Department of Social Welfare (DSW), OPSHG leaders, older people, health practitioners and local community health volunteers through the following approaches:

i)	Existing project staff will undergo refresher training, and new staff will undergo extensive training in Ageing and Development, the OPSHG concept, OPSHG formation, as well as other capacity building processes and skills necessary to work with older people and OPSHGs. 

ii)	Older people will be trained in; participatory approaches; gender mainstreaming; business planning and management, financial literacy, health care and hygiene, as well as technical knowledge in the agriculture, fishery, and livestock sectors and off-farming skills as required and reflecting individual needs.

iii)	OPSHG leaders will receive training in leadership, organizational development and management, financial planning and management, small scale savings and credit management, monitoring and evaluation techniques, HIV/Aids awareness, gender mainstreaming as well as of knowledge of specific issues with regards to livelihoods, health and home care, and DRR – to enable them to organize themselves and improve conditions within their communities.

iv)	A group of volunteers from within each community will be trained in home-based care-giving for frail and vulnerable older people. The capacity of the local health practitioners within the Department of Social Welfare to deliver quality health care and services to older people will also be enhanced through attending such training.
","A livelihood assessment in current project areas shows that the majority of older people have had few opportunities for basic education or technical training and that older people want to avoid, where possible, financial dependency on their families and are eager to be productive members of society. HelpAge experiences in both past, and ongoing projects reveal that older people in Myanmar are not, and have no wish to be, passive recipients of welfare schemes, they can, and do, play a pivotal/central role in improving socio-economic conditions within their communities, particularly in rural areas. 

Through OPSHGs, HelpAge seeks to bridge the gap between development programs and Older People’s needs and capacities in each of the target areas, which in turn, through OPSHGs, facilitates inter generational assistance to the broader communities.  No other NGOs currently address issues specific to older people in any of the current or proposed new project areas.

HelpAge USA,HELP-MW-10-5051,AFR077,"eyecare,health,older people","Advancing Healthy Communities - Affordable, Accessible and High Quality Eye Care","This project aims to improve the delivery of eye care services for a population of 8 million people across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, particularly in rural areas. This is being done by: enhancing the performance of eye health practitioners, thereby increasing the quality and number of cataract operations; providing people with effective and accessible eye care screenings, surgery and support both through primary health providers and referrals to eye-care specialists; and ensuring we leave a legacy of sustainable eye health programs through the promotion of good practices and knowledge of eye-care.

Cataract causes approximately half of blindness in Africa. The incidence of cataract in Sub Saharan Africa far outweighs the annual numbers being surgically treated. This is due to lack of awareness, lack of cataract surgeons and equipment, cost of surgery and poor accessibility especially in rural areas. 

The program will put in place an appropriately trained, functional, multidisciplinary mid-level eye care workforce that will focus on the coverage, quality and sustainability of eye health services to reduce the cataract surgical backlog in the three countries, thereby contributing to poverty alleviation in these countries. 
","Upgrading of infrastructure and provision of training equipment at the training institutions; Training of 38 cataract surgeons, 46 Ophthalmic Clinical Officers and 400 primary eye care workers; integration of primary eye care with the primary health systems and advocacy for eye health.

Community awareness has been listed as one of the main barriers towards the uptake of cataract surgery. To this end, the program will organize two weekly forums annually in the pilot regions around Old Persons’ Day and World Sight Day. Sightsavers International’s Communications Specialist and HelpAge International will lead in organizing the two forums.

The forums will aim at raising awareness on the project and its activities including cataract operations with departmental heads of government ministries, communities, media representatives as well as a cross section of CBO representatives. These forums will be used to sensitize the communities on the need to seek eye care services and on the role of the community in taking care of older persons within the community.

On increasing awareness on useful eye health practices, the program will also have a series of radio programs about eight weekly sessions per year in each on the three pilot sites. Sightsavers will lead in this activity in Malawi, HelpAge Zimbabwe and Coordinating Council for the Blind will lead in Zimbabwe, while Light For the World and HelpAge International will lead in Mozambique.
","The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that more than 314 million people worldwide live with serious visual impairment. Of these, 37 million are blind, 124 million have low vision and a further 153 million are visually impaired due to uncorrected refractive errors. As with poverty in general, Africa carries a disproportionate burden of blindness and visual impairment, with 19% of the world's blindness and only 10% of the world’s population. 

It is by now widely acknowledged that health workers, as an integral part of health systems, are a critical element in improving health outcomes. Sub-Saharan Africa faces the greatest challenges in human resourcing for health. While it has 11 percent of the world's population and 24 percent of the global burden of disease, it has only 3% of the world's health workers . The three targeted countries (Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe) are characterized by a grave shortage of ophthalmologists, with only 42 ophthalmologists for a population of 44 million   most of whom are based in the urban centers. This is against the WHO recommended target of 4 ophthalmologists per million population and 10 ophthalmic clinical officers (OCOs - a mid level eye care cadre) per million population. 

Four out of five people who will lose their sight will do so unnecessarily. It is in recognition of this projection that in 1999, WHO and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) launched a joint initiative known as V2020: The Right to Sight. This initiative provides a programmatic framework for eliminating avoidable blindness by the year 2020, by bringing together governments, non-governmental agencies, eye care professionals and other organizations involved in blindness prevention to facilitate planning, development and implementation of sustainable national eye care programs. This program contributes to this internationally agreed framework.",2010-01-01,2014-12-31,"",Health,"",401327,Sightsavers International,"",HelpAge International,625200,"Older people, children","Malawi,Mozambique,Zimbabwe","","",info@helpageusa.org,"",http://www.helpageusa.org,2014-05-08,2014-06-16,active,""

","- Train 120 older women as paralegals (5 per village), distribute legal kits and provide legal assistance at community level.

- Train 80 older women as rights spokespersons at district and regional level, of whom 36 will be selected to receive further training in order to participate in national level campaign work with the media, judiciary and parliamentarians.

- Train 50 other local NGO staff and establish a civil society advocacy network at regional level in order to promote the rights of older people.

- Lobby parliamentarians to strengthen enforcement of existing laws and introduce new legislation to effectively prevent violations of older people’s rights.   
","Problem Statement:

- High poverty levels among older people – 34% live in abject poverty (less than $1.25 per day). Poverty exacerbated by the fact that women over 60 years of age care for 53% of orphaned and vulnerable children (primarily as a result of the HIV/AIDS pandemic) and 40% of these women are widows.

- Traditional customs and discriminatory laws which promote gender inequality and gender-based violence resulting in extreme and widespread abuse of older women, especially in the Lake Victoria region of north western Tanzania – 33% of women reported they have been victims of violence and the murder rate of women accused of witchcraft continues to rise (579 reported deaths in 2010, 629 in 2011, 642 in 2012 and 322 during the first half of 2013). Moreover, local NGOs estimate that only 30-40% of crimes against elderly people are actually reported each year. Apart from customary superstitions associated with witchcraft, there is considerable documentary evidence to support the argument that witchcraft is simply used as a pretext to murder elderly women who are considered an unwelcome burden on poor younger relatives – research has identified a clear link between livelihood shocks and increased incidences of murder of older women.

- Lack of political will and accountability of law enforcement agencies perpetuated by a total lack of media/ public interest in rights violations of older people, including witchcraft murder/ violence cases.

- Older people, especially women, denied a voice as a result of total exclusion from participation in decision-making processes at the district, regional and national level.   

- Older people denied access to their legal entitlements such as free health care (85% of older people who seek free medical services in government facilities are denied on the grounds that they cannot afford treatment).",2013-12-01,2016-08-31,"","Human Rights Democracy and Governance,Protection","",500000,"","",HelpAge International,1200,Older women,"United Republic of Tanzania>Kagera,United Republic of Tanzania>Mwanza","","",info@helpageusa.org,"",http://www.helpageusa.org,2014-05-15,2014-06-16,active,""
HelpAge USA,HELP-TZ-13-5646,TAN000,"NCDs,older people",Supporting the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases Among Older People in Tanzania,"The overall goal of the project is to improve the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases among older people in three districts in Tanzania (Morogoro, Songea and Kibaha). The project will be implemented over a two-year period and will reach approximately 12,000 older people, 80 health care workers, 80 home-based caretakers, as well as 85 local council leaders and national government officials.","A range of activities will be implemented to raise awareness and provide basic
information to older people and their caretakers on healthy life styles and in
particular, the causes and prevention of non-communicable diseases. These will
include holding grassroots level training on NCDs with older people as well as
mobilizing and training home-based caretakers, peer educators and other community volunteers to champion active aging within the community. Older people will be supported to establish active aging clubs for physical activities including health promotion. 

HelpAge will work with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) to prepare and distribute simple dietary guidelines focusing on the common chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and respiratory infections and including key messages about the harmful effects of tobacco and alcohol.

In addition, Health workers and community health workers will be trained in early
diagnosis and treatment of NCDs, with an “on the job” training manual developed for middle level health care workers in collaboration with the MoHSW experts. The
training manual, although currently in draft form has been enriched with input from
various professionals within the MoHSW. We will work with the MoHSW to pilot the training programs in the districts where this project will be implemented. The training will create stronger ties between local health workers and communities. 

Feedback received from the initial training will result in modification of the curriculum and will enhance our ability to advocate for ultimate national curriculum review.","The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that non-communicable diseases will account for seven out of ten deaths by 2020 and current projections indicate that by that time the largest increases in NCD deaths will occur in Africa. In Tanzania, several studies indicate that NCD’s are indeed a growing problem for older people in particular, with the deaths of those 61 and older at close to 60% in some districts. The Tanzania National Strategy for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) of 2009 – 2015 identifies cardiovascular diseases, cervical and breast cancers, central diseases of the nervous systems, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases among the NCDs with the greatest impact.

Despite the growing threat of NCDs, disproportionate emphasis is placed on epidemics such as malaria, TB and HIV and AIDS and there is therefore a low level of awareness of the causes, symptoms, prevention and management of NCDs. Findings of a study by the Tanzania Healthcare and Career Awareness Program confirm this lack of awareness by older people and their caretakers, which can transform preventable diseases into debilitating chronic conditions. 

For instance, older people lack information on how alcohol and tobacco accelerate liver cancers. The research adds that: “many elderly die at home
because their caregivers are unaware of symptoms of hypertension, diabetes, lack of exercise and heart attack.”",2013-06-04,2015-06-04,"",Health,"",129900,"","",HelpAge International,12245,"Older people, health care workers, home-based caretakers","United Republic of Tanzania>Morogoro,United Republic of Tanzania>Pwani,United Republic of Tanzania>Ruvuma","","",info@helpageusa.org,"",http://www.helpageusa.org,2014-05-22,2014-06-16,active,""
HelpAge USA,HELP-TZ-14-5647,TAN001,"children,older people",Extending Healthy Aging through the Life Course: Intergenerational Interventions in Rural Tanzania,"The project is an extension of two pieces of current work in Tanzania. One is the Pfizer-funded project supporting the prevention and control of NCDs in three rural Districts of Tanzania, the other a UK Aid-funded research study undertaken in 2012 in one of the three districts covered by the Pfizer funding. The latter was a research study in the Kibaha District, Coast province, where academic researchers and HelpAge staff collaborated with a team of older people from a community in Kibaha to jointly investigate issues surrounding older people’s access to transport and mobility. Our aim was to develop methods which would help assess not only the direct impact of older people’s mobility on their own livelihoods and health seeking behavior, but also the broader impacts on younger generations in their families and communities and related issues of inter-generational poverty transmission.  

The 2012 study identified a number of key questions for further research which would inform the motivations and capacities of older people to utilize health services and to manage their own health status. It also identified the importance of life course approaches to understanding intra-household transmission of health knowledge. The current project seeks to address these issues through an inter-generational lens.  
","A key aspect of the project will be the training and deployment of community researchers of differing ages. We will identify groups of children and older people to be trained as co-researchers, using techniques that will be developed through the  support of Save the Children using their expertise in designing and conducting “child friendly’’ activities.  The research will also benefit from lessons and approaches adopted in similar research programs conducted by our research collaborators elsewhere in Africa.  

In Kibaha district alone there are 10 Active Age Clubs in 10 villages with a total of 206 male and 150 female members ranging in age from 60 to 85.  Evidence shows that at least 50-70% of these will be living in multigenerational households hence the potential for reaching out to a large number of children on key health issues.   Although current activities are by and large limited to traditional games and exchange of ideas that promote psycho-social support, the potential for these groups to expand the activities of the Active Aging Clubs as a forum to disseminate properly designed health messages  to reach both young and older people is enormous.  This project will enable us to develop a module/curriculum for the Active Aging Clubs that  can eventually be included in the two additional districts covered under the current Pfizer funded NCD project.  ","Demographic aging is affecting societies and individual lives in unprecedented ways. It impacts more than just the lives of people who are older themselves. The transition to older populations has challenged HelpAge to move beyond approaches which view older people simplistically as a vulnerable group, to address aging as an issue affecting the whole life course, both for individuals and societies. HelpAge adopts a life course approach which views lives as journeys with many different phases and transitions along the way, none of which are seen in isolation from each other. It recognizes that the decisions people make about their lives, and the way they are treated by others, are affected by what they have experienced in their past and what they hope for their future. To ensure healthier aging, and to progressively improve health and quality of life from one age cohort to the next over successive generations, we need to build beyond a focus on the management and treatment of illnesses. We need also to understand how mid-life and younger age groups can age more healthily so that their old age is lived in better health. In practical terms, this means for example:  including younger age groups in health promotion work as well as in prevention programs. This also includes providing geriatric care in health training and running intergenerational interaction programs; bringing young people and older people together to improve health and quality of life in old age. There is a growing awareness of the importance of the relationships between generations in Africa. This is due to two interlinked trends: firstly, the relatively rapid growth of mid-life and older populations in many African countries, and secondly, the growing prevalence of households in which grandparents and grandchildren are supporting and caring for each other because of a missing or incapacitated middle generation due to either economic migration or HIV and AIDS.",2014-04-01,2015-03-30,"",Health,"",118000,Save the Children,"",HelpAge International,"","",United Republic of Tanzania,"","",info@helpageusa.org,"",http://www.helpageusa.org,2014-05-22,2014-06-16,active,Pfizer

Dubbed a super typhoon, Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) was responsible for 3,976 confirmed deaths, with an additional 1,598 missing and 18,175 injured*, damaged or destroyed homes numbering in the 100,000s, paralyzed local governments and economies, and crippled transportation, power and telecommunications systems throughout the region.

Our initial work will focus on helping residents clear debris and salvage any materials that can be re-used. We hope to have funding for a home repair program that involves supplying materials, labor, and volunteers. Ideally funding will also be available to create a transitional shelter program (t-shelters). The t shelter design incorporates indigenous materials that are erected to provide a safe, dignified living space for 3-5 years.","Program Details 
 
In Leyte we are engaged in cleaning up the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan by helping local residents to deconstruct their badly damaged homes, making the property safe again, and providing reusable materials to the family. We will also be clearing the lots to make way for new structures and drainage ditches to ensure proper drainage and sanitation. Programs will continue evolve over the life the project. We are actively pursuing a rebuild project as a high priority.

Many victims of typhoon Yolanda are still living in improvised shelters or tents close to flood prone areas of Tacloban. All Hands Volunteers will be working with Operation Blessing and the city of Tacloban to construct  transitional housing at a temporary relocation site where typhoon victims will live while permanent housing is  constructed nearby. Volunteers will be working side by side with the beneficiary population to build the houses in  which they will live.","The All Hands Story 
Our story begins in 2005, after the devastating Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in December 2004.  Business professional David Campbell spontaneously headed to Thailand to see how he could help. His intended one-week volunteer visit turned into a month, during which he co-founded HandsOnThailand, bringing in more than 200 other spontaneous volunteers to rebuild five fishing villages in Phuket.

These episodes significantly compromise patients’ ability to work or carry out normal day-to-day tasks. This will be tested by randomly allocating podoconiosis patients to one of two groups: either to ‘standard’ treatment or to delayed treatment.

In order to build resilient communities, families have taken the initiative to apply ancestral techniques that will mitigate the impact of floodings, drought and high levels of salinity in the water.

The project will be conducted with 964 families in the department of Córdoba, Colombia's Caribbean coast, who live in the communities of the municipalities of Lorica, San Bernardo del Viento, Cotorra, Chima, Purisima and San Antero. These families live in rural areas, and are usually engaged in fishing, agro-ecology horticulture and raising small livestock. For this three-year project, the families will learn and apply techniques of soil and water management that will allow them to have a sustainable food production that not only ensures the provision of basic food, but also the income a family needs to live.

Purpose: Families and communities that are associated with the natural eco-systems  in the lower basin of the Sinu River, have improved their resilience to the impacts of climate change.

Outcome 1: Farming and fishing families of San Bernardo del Viento, Cotorra, Chima, Purisima and San Antero that are involved in agroecological production have a greater capacity to adapt to climate change.

Outcome 2: Communities and local authorities of Lorica, San Bernardo del Viento, Cotorra, Chima, Purisima and San Antero proposed climate risk management plans that answer to the geographical and environmental vulnerabilities of the territory.

The project directly involves 231 women and 733 men, who are part of community groups affiliated to the Association of Fishermen, Farmers, Indigenous and African Descent Community Development of the Cienaga Grande of the Basin Sinu River (ASPROCIG). 

One of the greatest strengths of ASPROCIG is based on its local network of field workers.

The project will invest heavily in community-owned health services and systems, creating sustainable positive momentum that will ultimately result in improved well-being of the populations of Northern Uganda for years to come, in some of the most remote and hard-to-reach communities in the region. 
<br><br>
The project's goal is to improve and sustain the health and nutrition status of the targeted population through a district-based integrated package of quality health services, with two main strategic objectives:
Strategic Objective 1: Increase the use of people-centered integrated health services at facility and community level;
Strategic Objective 2: Strengthen systems for effective and sustainable delivery of quality health services at different levels and sites of care within the health system of the region
<br><br>
The Plan-led project team brings a wealth of expertise in essential high impact health services delivery, technical innovations, and best practices in health systems strengthening. Together with established proven approaches in community engagement and mobilization, this partnership will help to create a dynamic community-owned health system. Operationally, NU-HITES will be a regionally-based project with three sub-regional offices (Lira, Kitgum and Gulu) under the management of sub-regional coordinators. A central project office located in Gulu will house the Program Leadership Team (PLT) and the main cadre of technical advisors. The project will embed technical specialists in the disciplines of health and nutrition; community advocacy and accountability; HIV coordination; training, monitoring and evaluation; and finance. A Plan USA team in Washington D.C. will provide program management support. A team of Plan technical experts based in Africa and the U.S. will provide short-term technical assistance to NU-HITES.

The primary focus of this program is to raise awareness on Zoonotic Diseases, build capacity for prevention and response, and integrate surveillance efforts within existing government efforts. Since two thirds of emerging diseases affecting humans originate with animals, RI utilizes an integrated approach towards this end; working with community animal health workers, public health workers, schools and civil society organizations, with research institutions and higher education facilities to introduce zoonoses curricula and support issue based research. The LfL program works with laboratories to introduce bio-safety and biosecurity mechanisms with which to protect technicians and the wider community, and to guard against the use of harmful pathogens by terrorist elements. The Livestock for Life program has been running for five years, and has fostered close coordination between the Agriculture (Livestock), Health, Wildlife and Education Ministries in all countries, understanding the need for collaboration to control diseases which span multiple traditionally separate sectors, and introducing technical committees which have a cross-cutting mandate for zoonoses disease surveillance and control. Our current countries of impact combine fragile and conflict affected states, where the poorest and most vulnerable have a high reliance on livestock; Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya.

Their main source of household energy is firewood, which is becoming more scarce every year. Starting in 2012, Solar Cookers International is funding Safe Water Packages to be distributed to FOTO beneficiaries. Their primary focus is helping economically disempowered senior citizens who take care of their orphaned grandchildren.

A Safe Water Package includes a CooKit, a supply of heat-resistant plastic bags, a cooking pot, a clay pot for safe water storage, a fuel-efficient woodstove and a retained-heat cooking basket. FOTO wants to provide elderly community members with a way to have safe drinking water, while also reducing the burden of gathering firewood and the dangerous exposure of women and children to cooking smoke. FOTO monitors the progress of its projects through home visits and monthly and quarterly management meetings. Nearly 84% of beneficiaries continue to use the integrated cooking devices two months after distribution.

SPOON Foundation,spn-TJ-14-5190,"","",Improving Nutrition amongst Vulnerable Orphans in Tajikistan’s Baby Homes,"This project aims to improve the nutritional status of vulnerable infants and young children living in all baby homes in Tajikistan through evidence-based and scalable interventions. Interventions will focus on building caregiver knowledge and skills and institutional systems for improving ability to detect malnutrition risk factors, delivery of appropriate care, and diet quality. Given the increasing number of children with disabilities (CWD) in Tajikistan baby homes, all interventions will be tailored to be inclusive of CWD by also addressing their unique nutrition and feeding needs. 

SPOON expects to directly reach 800 children (500 through Tajikistan’s 4 baby homes and 300 served by the community support centers adjacent to the baby homes for CWD) by the end of year 2, followed by approximately 250 additional children (expected new baby home admissions and new child enrollment at the community centers) annually thereafter. To promote sustainability, SPOON will work closely with local government and our partner HealthProm, a NGO with extensive experience working with the Tajik government to improve social care for vulnerable children, to build local capacity to own the problem and solutions over the long-term by ensuring their involvement in all aspects of project design and implementation. ","The Ministry of Health (MOH) would like to expand a 2013 SPOON assessment to include rural communities where health indicators are expected to be worse, as well as typically developing children. Two key benefits of expansion will be a broadened understanding of the overall problem, and in turn better informed and designed solutions. This data will also serve to promote sustainable change by forming the evidence base for catalyzing national policy reform for improving diets for children living in institutional care both now and in future.

Next, SPOON will customize and implement a Nutrition Screening System (NSS) in all baby homes. This system enables early detection of malnutrition related risk factors amongst children and guides caregivers through the correct steps for appropriate action - ultimately preventing the permanent consequences of malnutrition. The NSS is comprised of five key components: a nutrition screening form, treatment and referral decision tree flow charts, a customized simple Access database for information management and reporting, training materials and NSS user guides, and M&E protocols for assessing overall NSS performance. Training will be conducted to equip baby home staff who will be responsible for maintaining the NSS, with the skills needed to use the system as well as assess and monitor a child’s growth. 

To improve caregiver knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to nutrition and feeding, SPOON’s technical team will conduct trainings covering topics such as: nutrition basics and understanding malnutrition; hygiene, sanitation and safe food preparation; safe feeding practices for children in institutional care and for CWD. SPOON utilizes a Training of Trainers (TOT) model to establish and expand local partner competency on technical nutrition and feeding content and effective techniques for teaching others. ","Malnutrition in Tajikistan remains a significant public health problem, where 1 in 3 children under 5 are stunted – a consequence of chronic malnutrition.  Iron deficiency anemia also affects nearly 1/3 of the population’s children. For children living in institutions, malnutrition is further compounded by additional, often unrecognized risk factors that increase their susceptibility to infectious morbidities, disability, and even death. In Tajikistan, SPOON has documented rates of malnutrition amongst children living in one institution as high as 93%, astronomically higher than the 16% GAM rate indicative of a humanitarian emergency. Surmounting research links malnutrition in the first years of life, not only with reduced cognitive performance, but also diminished socioeconomic outcomes throughout adulthood.

Children are placed in institutional care for a variety of reasons including poverty, parents migrating in search of employment, and stigma - particularly around CWD. The number of CWD in Tajikistan is on the rise for numerous reasons - resurgence of debilitating diseases like polio, micronutrient deficiencies, poor health care, and cultural practice such as inter-family marriage. 

Once in an institution, children are generally fed a diet lacking food diversity and low in nutrient density, insufficient to achieve normal growth and brain development. Furthermore, improper feeding practices can prevent safe consumption of food, limiting nutritional intake and increasing risk of aspiration, which can be life threatening. Yet, this community of vulnerable children are consistently overlooked and excluded from development programs, including malnutrition prevention efforts primarily delivered through family structures – further exacerbating their isolation and impeding development. Eliminating the marginalization of these children and addressing malnutrition is critical to maximizing their chance to be placed with a family, grow, and reach their full potential",2014-04-01,2016-03-31,"","Health,Other","Nutrition, early childhood, children with disabilities, orphanages",142698,HealthProm,"",SPOON Foundation,800,"children with disabilities, children under 5 living in orphanages",Tajikistan,Emily Brod,Director of Finance & Operationss,emily@spoonfoundation.org,+1-503-501-6505,"",2014-05-13,2014-05-13,active,Vibrant Village Foundation

The project focuses on improving: nutrition; maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) services; reproductive health/family planning services; water, sanitation and hygiene; and home-based gardening in 20 districts. The project works within the government system, primarily through Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) and other community extension workers. FCHVs disseminate health messages, services and commodities at the household level and through mothers’ group discussion forums. For 20 years, the GON, other donors, and USAID have increased the knowledge and skills of this cadre of FCHV’s and their female neighbors through a family health-based curriculum. The volunteers are now building on that knowledge and developing demonstration farms encompassing poultry farming, productive sanitation, integrated pest control and nutritious vegetables. Suaahara integrates health, nutrition, agriculture and food security activities. Complementary nutrition and hygiene education, small-scale backyard farming, and greater access to and understanding of the need for a variety of healthy foods will improve the impact of agriculture production and economic development on nutritional status in the Mid- and Far-West regions.

The MDG Union Strategy is a demand-driven social development process in which communities move through phases of development at their own pace, self-directing and engaging in community priorities of their own choosing. The work proceeds through four phases: (i) Mobilization, (ii) Capacity Building, (iii) Taking action, and (iv) Assessing results. An MDG Union is a cluster of nine Bangladeshi villages that through partnership with THP has committed to achieving the MDGs at the local level. The MDGs will be achieved through increased engagement of active and informed citizens, enhanced democratic processes, and improved access to resources. </p> <br>

In 2013, 93 women and 115 men participated in 13 Vision Commitment Action Workshops (VCAs) in Maulvibazar. VCAs are workshops to mobilize communities around volunteer action.

Activities foster a partnership between the people, their elected local government representatives and, wherever possible, the government functionaries at the grassroots in order to help achieve the MDGs. The centerpiece of The Hunger Project's strategy is the local level training and ongoing support of nearly 270,000 volunteer Animators, 60 percent of whom are women, who organize mass action campaigns in their areas. As mentioned above, the animators focus their actions in clusters of villages known as unions and work closely with the elected local government bodies, holding trainings focused on gender issues and leadership to local women leaders. These leaders then proceed to organize local meetings, lead workshops and initiate campaigns against early marriage and dowry, malnutrition, maternal and child mortality, gender discrimination, and inequality, illiteracy and corruption.</p>","<p>The Hunger Project has been active in Bangladesh since 1990 and is currently active in 29 districts, reaching 4.5 million people. The Hunger Project’s strategies in Bangladesh occur on two scales: one focuses on the local landscape at the union level (as described above), the other on the national, with significant strategic overlap. At the national level, The Hunger Project addresses two pernicious cultural conditions that form major barriers to ending hunger in Bangladesh: youth development, gender discrimination and corruption. This is done through Youth Ending Hunger (YEH), the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum (NGCAF) and Shujan (Citizens for Good Governance).  Thousands of students participate in the YEH program, which mobilizes students across the country to conduct national campaigns based on such issues as nutrition, education, family planning, tree planting and environmental education. The Hunger Project catalyzed the creation of the national alliance NGCAF, committed to ending all forms of discrimination against girls. Each year on September 30, this alliance organizes National Girl Child Day events across the country. A formal alliance of 300 organizations, the NGCAF also works to address domestic violence and the spread of HIV/AIDS. Shujan is a country-wide platform of committed, active and socially conscious citizens, mobilized by The Hunger Project, to strengthen grassroots democracy, ensure transparency and accountability of local government, and carry out advocacy initiatives at the national level.

Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application).

These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain.

Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping.

Through this fully integrated development strategy, community members establish and manage their own programs to address food security, nutrition, health, education, microfinance, water and sanitation. Epicenters follow four distinct phases over a period of about five to eight years on a path toward to sustainable self-reliance.</p> <br> 

<p>Ouissi Epicenter is currently in Phase 3, during which the epicenter community shores up the progress that it has made since its inception, while beginning to plan for a transition to self-reliance. Trainings are led by community-based animators, and epicenter committees manage each program, including budget oversight and leadership transitions. The epicenter strengthens its partnerships, including solidifying and creating an even more powerful partnership with local government.

","<p>The Hunger Project promotes a holistic approach to food security, and many of its activities contribute to increased access to sufficient food but also improved diets, greater nutritional variety and stronger ties to local resources. For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs.</p>

","<p>Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.
Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping.

Through this fully integrated development strategy, community members establish and manage their own programs to address food security, nutrition, health, education, microfinance, water and sanitation. Epicenters follow four distinct phases over a period of about five to eight years on a path toward to sustainable self-reliance.</p> <br> 

<p>Machakel Epicenter is currently in Phase 3, during which the epicenter community shores up the progress that it has made since its inception, while beginning to plan for a transition to self-reliance. Trainings are led by community-based animators, and epicenter committees manage each program, including budget oversight and leadership transitions. The epicenter strengthens its partnerships, including solidifying and creating an even more powerful partnership with local government. Machakel epicenter serves 24 villages with a total population of 11,907 women, men and children in the East Gojjam zone of <a href=""http://www.thp.org/ETHIOPIA/"">Ethiopia</a>. </p> <br> 

<p>In 2013, Machakel community partners added 2,940 kgs of grain to their community food bank, which provides reliable, pest-free storage for excess harvest and ensures the food security of villagers during the off-season. </p>

","<p>The Hunger Project promotes a holistic approach to food security, and many of its activities contribute to increased access to sufficient food but also improved diets, greater nutritional variety and stronger ties to local resources. For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs.</p>","<p>Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.
Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping.

","<p>The Hunger Project promotes a holistic approach to food security, and many of its activities contribute to increased access to sufficient food but also improved diets, greater nutritional variety and stronger ties to local resources. For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs.</p>

","<p>Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.
Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping. The food bank is managed by a local Food Security Committee, which oversees the operations of the entire program; each committee is made up of equal numbers of men and women and is democratically elected by the epicenter populations.</p>

","<p>The Hunger Project promotes a holistic approach to food security, and many of its activities contribute to increased access to sufficient food but also improved diets, greater nutritional variety and stronger ties to local resources. For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs.</p>

","<p>Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.
Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping. The food bank is managed by a local Food Security Committee, which oversees the operations of the entire program; each committee is made up of equal numbers of men and women and is democratically elected by the epicenter populations.</p>

The Hunger Project,THP-IN-01-4878,"",foodsecurity_site,Jahanabad: Elected Women Representatives Empowerment,"<p>The Hunger Project-India (THP) uses a multi-pronged strategy to strengthen the political leadership and participation of elected women representatives (EWRs) in Gram Panchayats (GPs). The strategies aim to build the capacities of individual EWRs and an enabling environment for them to exercise their leadership effectively. The Hunger Project facilitates the leadership of these women leaders with key interventions in each year of their five year tenures: Year One: Conduct Women Leadership Workshops (WLW) and follow-up needs-based workshops to strengthen skills of women leaders; Year Two: Work with leaders to create bottom-up plans for villages to meet basic needs; Year Three: Facilitate the formation of federations at district and state level to overcome bureaucratic obstacles; Year Four: Focus on ensuring successful implementation of plans and policy changes, and; Year Five: Carry out campaigns to encourage participation of women as voters and as candidates in the run-up to elections. </p> <br>

<p>The Hunger Project has been working with elected women representatives in the state of Bihar since 2001, having organized a workshop with EWRs and Civil Society Organizations immediately following Panchayat elections. Work with EWRs eventually progressed to Women’s Leadership Workshops, adopting the five-year planned cycle in 2005. The Hunger Project has successfully prevented the implementation of the Two-Child Norm in Panchayats in Bihar. The Two-Child Norm, ostensibly an effort at curbing population growth, is a legal provision that systematically prevents the participation of female representatives with more than two children. </p> <br>

<p>Jahanabad is a district in the northern state of Bihar. THP works in 52 Gram Panchayats in three blocks in Jahanabad: Kako, Jahanabad and Makhdumpur. In 2013, 20 Jahanabad Federations meetings took place at the block level, with 831 Elected Women Representatives participating. Federations provide elected women representatives (EWRs) a legitimate platform through which to collectively bargain and demand rights as EWRs. As an informed group, they are able to represent and protect their own interests, and advocate for issues of accountable governance, inclusive democracy, a gender sensitive society and a pro-women policy environment. </p>","<p>The Hunger Project, in partnership with many local civil society organizations, has trained more than 79,000 elected women representatives. Examples of the activities within this strategy include:</p> 

<p>Empowering Women in Elections: To encourage voter participation among women and nominations of potential women leaders, The Hunger Project conducts intensive pre-election campaigns. SWEEP (Strengthening Women's Empowerment in Electoral Processes) campaigns include meetings, film screenings, street plays, door-to-door contacts, trainings and distribution of posters and pamphlets.</p>

<p>Federations for Advocacy and Mutual Empowerment: To empower women leaders and their communities, The Hunger Project supports the formation of federations among their elected leaders to voice their concerns as a collective unit.</p>

<p>Mobilizing the Media to Support Women Leaders: To highlight the work of women leaders and Panchayati Raj, The Hunger Project actively engages with the media and annually awards the Sarojini Naidu Prize, showcasing the efforts being made by the elected women and recognizes three journalists reporting on their work in Hindi, English and other Indian language categories.</p>","<p>The Hunger Project has been active in India since 1984 and currently works across seven states, 60 districts, and more than 3,000 village clusters (panchayats).

Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping.

For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs.</p>","<p>Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.
Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping. The food bank is managed by a local Food Security Committee, which oversees the operations of the entire program; each committee is made up of equal numbers of men and women and is democratically elected by the epicenter populations.</p>

These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.
Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping.

<p>During 2013, 1188 people participated in The Hunger Project food security workshops at Kiboga Epicenter, through which they learn sustainable practices to improve crop yields. Also in 2013, Kiboga community partners added 5,000 kgs of grain to their community food bank, which provides reliable, pest-free storage for excess harvest and ensures the food security of villagers during the off-season. </p>

","<p>The Hunger Project promotes a holistic approach to food security, and many of its activities contribute to increased access to sufficient food but also improved diets, greater nutritional variety and stronger ties to local resources. For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs.</p>","<p>Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.
Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping. The food bank is managed by a local Food Security Committee, which oversees the operations of the entire program; each committee is made up of equal numbers of men and women and is democratically elected by the epicenter populations.</p>

<p>In 2013, Mbale community partners added 2,560 kgs of grain to their community food bank, which provides reliable, pest-free storage for excess harvest and ensures the food security of villagers during the off-season. </p>

","<p>The Hunger Project promotes a holistic approach to food security, and many of its activities contribute to increased access to sufficient food but also improved diets, greater nutritional variety and stronger ties to local resources. For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs.</p>","<p>Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.
Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping. The food bank is managed by a local Food Security Committee, which oversees the operations of the entire program; each committee is made up of equal numbers of men and women and is democratically elected by the epicenter populations.</p>

One of these programs, the Artisans Association of Cambodia (AAC), has now been active for 12 years.  During the initial design phase of the program, needs assessments suggested that Cambodian artisans were developing craft items that had the potential for substantial international marketing and sales.  Assessments showed that most efforts in that area were being carried out by small grass-roots organizations whose know-how about such aspects as design, production quality, marketing, inventory control, and store display was limited.  WRF decided to organize an artisan association which would provide an opportunity to share information and comprehensive training to improve design, production, purchasing strategies, pricing and marketing.  The AAC started with four organizations, all of whom were primarily groups supporting artisans with disabilities.

World Animal Protection,WSPA-PH-13-7565,"","Disaster,Haiyan",Typhoon Haiyan Disaster Response,"After Typhoon Haiyan made landfall on the 8th of November, World Animal Protection's rescue teams deployed to help the animal victims of the storm, bringing hope to distraught animal owners by saving 17,400 farm animals and pets from injuries, starvation and disease. 

Attention has now been turned to the design of a long term recovery plan which will facilitate a smooth transition from World Animal Protection's immediate response work in Cebu, Panay and Leyte. This will ensure a continued support for animals, in partnership with local and national government authorities. 

World Animal Protection's recovery plan consists of two focal projects:

The first is to provide additional preparedness capacity through the selection, training and equipping of mobile emergency veterinary teams on the island of Panay. Increasing the mobility and the training of the provincial veterinary services will provide faster and more accurate assessments and a domestic rapid response function for inevitable future cyclones. 

The second project focuses on a technology transfer from Cuba of hurricane resistant sheltering to be deployed as a replicable model through academic partners. This model will offer a working example of how to reduce animal mortality and suffering and the associated economic loss to a very low level. This recovery project plan will take place only on the island of Panay.
","Immediate Response:

Delivery of veterinary care, fodder/mineral supplements and vaccinations to backyard and companion animals across seven municipalities in NW Panay Island;

Medical aid provided to companion animals and livestock, and emergency feed to swine due to broken feed supply lines to secure the rebuilding of the swine population on the island of Leyte;

Provision of emergency veterinary kits to vet technicians across the seven most affected municipalities of Antique province. 

Long Term Recovery Projects:

Increasing preparedness capacity through training and equipping of mobile vet teams on Panay to provide faster and more accurate assessments and rapid response functions for future cyclones;

Construction of hurricane resistant underground shelter construction in Panay - 
a Natural Pig Farming System and two underground livestock shelters were built during early February and stocked with both pigs and cattle (10 off and 2 off respectively). This project is now in a monitoring phase for the next two years with the aim of proving itself economically viable, humane, and a successful model of how to reduce mortality during and after cyclones.

World Animal Protection,XXXX-MX-12-5361,"","animal welfare,Disaster,drought,livelihoods,Mexico",How Healthy Animals Protect Livelihoods and Build Community Resilience,"When the state of Chihuahua experienced devastating drought both animals and
people suffered. World Animal Protection partnered with the Aldama District Municipality to deliver an innovative and effective response that considered both animals’ and people’s needs and demonstrated how integrated planning can rebuild and strengthen community resilience.<br><br>The people of Mexico’s largest state, located in the arid north-west, are largely economically dependent on agriculture and livestock, in particular on cattle farming. But at the start of 2012, they faced the consequences of two years of drought and three successive failed farming seasons. Without rain, green pasture dried up; what was left was overgrazed. Malnourished cattle were forced to eat fallen leaves and cotton leftovers from nearby plantations.<br><br>As livestock deaths rose to the thousands, the people of Chihuahua were desperately in need of an action plan that would protect the lives and welfare of their remaining animals and by extension protect their long-term economic prospects.<br><br>Recognizing that for regional recovery the livestock needed not only to survive but also to thrive, the local government of Aldama (a Chihuahuan municipality) approached World Animal Protection to work in partnership with them.<br><br>Together, World Animal Protection and the government carried out a series of interventions that addressed the immediate welfare of at least 220 families and approximately 2,500 animals, with the long-term potential to help many more.","World Animal Protection's disaster team began by talking to local people and facilitating the formation of a community emergency committee. This early dialogue ensured that the animal-focused disaster reduction and recovery measures we introduced were supported and in many cases implemented by local people.<br><br>After distributing mineral blocks to farmers to offer immediate protection for suffering cattle, World Animal Protection 's response focused on sustainable action that would build community resilience to droughts in this arid region over the long term. <br><br>Together with the government, World Animal Protection:<li>built two wells and a borehole to provide water for livestock and irrigate cactus plots<li>planted indigenous cacti to provide an emergency animal food source in times of drought<li>provided the parts and expertise to construct a water pump<li>advised on the construction of modified ‘sand dams’, a type of retention pond World Animal Protection had seen in use in northern Kenya. These collect run-off rain water to supply animals and pastureland. Built with the help of local families, the small reservoirs created by these dams now exist as an ongoing cost-effective risk reduction measure with the potential to benefit many thousands of animals and people in future emergencies. <br><br>Over the following two years, World Animal Protection continued a fruitful partnership with the authorities in Aldama.  Drought-mitigation plans included development of a community education program on sustainable action against climate change.","As World Animal Protection's work in Chihuahua and elsewhere demonstrates, disaster risk reduction planning that integrates the welfare of animals and the people who rely on them can:<li>reduce the effects of future disasters<li>protect livelihoods, the economy and social well-being<li>decrease animal loss and suffering<li>increase a community’s ability to cope without government or NGO intervention<li>access the most innovative thinking from across different fields of expertise.<br><br>World Animal Protection's long experience in the field of disaster management has shown that helping animals helps people. It has shown that the integration of animals into emergency planning and disaster risk reduction measures is fundamental to achieving effective, sustainable outcomes.<br><br>This reality is increasingly understood and recognized within the humanitarian and global development communities. In particular, the post-2015 and post-Hyogo movements can provide a space in which together we can examine the need to incorporate under-recognized themes (including animal welfare) in disaster risk management, and how this can be achieved.
